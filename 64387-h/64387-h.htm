<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFATORY_NOTE">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> following essays were written during a period of more
than thirty years, and published at intervals of varying
lengths. The oldest of them appeared in <i>Les Monuments
de l’Art Antique</i> of my friend Olivier Rayet, and the
others in <i>La Nature</i> at the request of Gaston Tissandier, in
the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, in the <i>Monuments Piot</i>, and
chiefly in the <i>Revue de l’Art Ancien et Moderne</i>, where my
friend Jules Comte gave them hospitality. As most of
these periodicals do not circulate in purely scientific circles,
the essays are almost unknown to experts, and will for
the greater part be new to them. Indeed, they were not
intended for them. In writing them, I desired to familiarize
the general public, who were scarcely aware of their existence,
with some of the fine pieces of Egyptian sculpture
and goldsmiths’ work, and to point out how to approach
them in order to appreciate their worth. Some, after various
vicissitudes, had found a home in the Museums of Paris or
of Cairo, and I wrote the notices in my study, deducing
at leisure the reasons for my criticisms. Others I caught
as they emerged from the ground, the very day of or the
day after their discovery, and I described them on the
spot, as it were, under the influence of my first encounter
with them: they themselves dictated to me what I said
of them.</p>

<p>Some persons will perhaps be surprised to find the same
ideas developed at length in several parts of the book. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
they will carry their thoughts back to the date at which I
wrote, they will recognize the necessity of such repetitions.
Egyptologists, absorbed in the task of deciphering, had
eyes for scarcely anything except the historical or religious
literary texts; and so amateurs or inquirers, finding nothing
in the works of experts to help them to any sound interpretation
of the characteristic manifestations of Egyptian
art, were reduced to register them without always understanding
them, for lack of knowledge of the concepts that
had imposed their forms on them. It is now admitted that
such objects of art are above all utilitarian, and that they
were originally commissioned with the fixed purpose of
assuring the well-being of human survival in an existence
beyond the grave. Thirty years ago, few were aware of
this, and to convince the rest, it was necessary to insist
continually on the proofs and to multiply examples. I
might of course have suppressed a portion of them here,
but had I done so, should I not have been reproached, and
quite rightly, with misrepresenting and almost falsifying a
passage in the history of the Egyptian arts? The ideas
which govern our present conception did not at once reach
the point where they now are. They came into being one
after the other, and spread themselves by successive waves
of unequal intensity, welcomed with favour by some,
rejected by others. I had to begin over again a dozen
times and in a dozen different ways before I obtained their
almost universal acceptation. I was at first laughed at
when I put forward the opinion that there was not one
unique art in Egypt, identical from one extremity of the
valley to the other except for almost imperceptible nuances
of execution, but that there were at least half a dozen local
schools, each with its own traditions and its own principles,
often divided into several studios, the technique of which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
tried to determine. In the end the incredulous rallied to
my side, and it would have been bad grace on my part to
leave out of the articles which helped to convert them, at
least I hope so, the repetitions which led to their being
convinced.</p>

<p>Besides, I am sure that they will render my readers of
to-day the same service that they rendered formerly to my
colleagues in Egyptology. When they have thoroughly
entered into the spirit of the Egyptian ideas concerning
existence in this world and the next, they will understand
what Egyptian art is, and why it is above everything
realistic. The question for Egyptian art was not to create
a type of independent beauty in the person of the
individuals who furnish the principal elements of it, but to
express truthfully the features which constituted that
person and which must be preserved identical as long as
anything of him persisted among the living and the dead.
But why should I epitomize here in a necessarily incomplete
way ideas which are amply set forth in the book itself? I
shall do better in using the small space left me in thanking
the publishers who have kindly authorized me to reproduce
the illustrations which accompanied my articles, Jules
Comte, the directors of <i>La Nature</i>, and my old friends of
the firm of Hachette. They have thus collaborated in this
book, and it will owe a large part of its success to their
kindness.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">I opened</span> F.W. von Bissing’s work<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> with a certain feeling
of melancholy, for it was a thing that I had hoped to do
myself. Ebers had suggested to Bruckmann, the publisher,
that he should entrust the task to me, and I was on the
point of arranging with him when the preparations for an
Orientalist Congress to meet at Paris in 1897 deprived
me of the leisure left me by my lectures and the printing
of my “History,” and I was forced to give up the project.
Herr von Bissing, who was less occupied then than I
was, consented to hazard the adventure, and no one
could have been better equipped than he was to carry
it through. The seeking of materials, the execution of
typographical <i>clichés</i>, the composition of the text and its
careful setting forth exacted eight years of travelling and
continuous labour. Bissing issued the first part at the
end of 1905, and five other parts have quickly followed,
forming almost the half of the work, seventy-two plates
folio, and the portions of the explanatory text belonging
to the plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The title is not, at least as yet, exactly accurate.
Egyptian sculpture includes, in fact, besides statues and
groups in alto-relievo, bas-reliefs often of very large
dimensions which adorn the tombs or the walls of temples.
Now Bissing has only admitted statues and groups to
the honours of publication: the few specimens of the
bas-reliefs that he gives are not taken from the ruins themselves,
but have been selected from pieces in the museums,
stelæ, or fragments of ruined buildings. It is then the
monuments of Egyptian statuary that he presents to us
rather than those of Egyptian sculpture as a whole.</p>

<p>Having made that statement and thus defined the
extent of the field of action, it must be frankly admitted
that he has always made a happy selection of pieces to be
reproduced. Doubtless we may regret the absence of some
famous pieces, such as the Crouching Scribe of the Louvre
or the Cow of Deîr el-Baharî. The fault is not his, and
perhaps he will succeed in overcoming the obstacles which
forced him to deprive us of them. The omissions, at
any rate, are not numerous. When the list printed on
the covers of the first part is exhausted, amateurs and
experts will have at their disposal nearly everything
required to follow the evolution of Egyptian statuary
from its earliest beginnings to the advent of Christianity.
The schools of the Greek and Roman epochs, unjustly
contemned by archæologists who have written on these
subjects, are not wanting, and for the first time the
ordinary reader can decide for himself if all the artists
of the decadence equally deserve contempt or oblivion.
Bissing has attempted a complete picture, not a sketch
restricted to the principal events in art between the IVth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Dynasty and the XXXth. No serious attempt of the
kind had before been made, and on many points he had
to open out the roads he traversed. For the moment he
has stopped at the beginning of the Saïte period; thus
we have as yet no means of judging if the plan he has
imposed on himself is carried out to the end with a
rigour and firmness everywhere equal: but a rapid
examination of the parts that have appeared will show
that it has been executed with fullness and fidelity.</p>

<p>Four plates are devoted to Archaic Egypt: the two
first are facsimiles of the bas-reliefs that decorate the
stele of the Horus Qa-âou, and the so-called <i>palette</i> of
the king we designate Nâr-mer, since we have not
deciphered his name. It is in truth very little, but the
excavations have rendered such poor accounts of those
distant ages that it is almost all that could be given of
them; it might, however, have been worth while to add
the statuettes of the Pharaoh Khâsakhmouî. Notwithstanding
the omission, the objects that appear give a
sufficient idea of the degree of skill attained by the
sculptors of those days. The stele of Qa-âou does not,
of course, equal that of the <i>King-Serpent</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> which is in
the Louvre; it is, however, of a fairly good style, and the
hawk of Horus is nearer to the real animal than those
of the protocol were later. Similarly the scenes engraved
on the <i>palette</i> of Nâr-mer testify to an indisputable
virtuosity in the manner of attacking the stone. The
drawing of the persons is less schematic and their bearing
freer than in the compositions of classical art, but it is
evident that the craftsman had as yet no very clear
idea of the way in which to compose a picture and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
group its elements. Let us confess, nevertheless, that the
bas-reliefs are far superior to the statues yet known. We
possess about half a dozen of them scattered over the
world. Bissing studied one to the exclusion of the others,
the one in the Naples Museum, and it may be thought
to be sufficient if only æsthetic impressions are desired,
for nothing could be rougher or more awkward. The
head and face might perhaps pass, but the rest is ill-proportioned,
the neck is too short, the shoulders and
chest are massive, the legs lack slenderness under a heavy
petticoat, the feet and hands are enormous. The defects
cannot be ascribed to the hardness of the material, for the
Scribe of the Cairo Museum, which is in limestone,
displays them as flagrantly as the good people in granite
at Naples, Munich, or Leyden. I must not therefore
conclude, however, that they are constant faults with the
Thinites: the statuettes of Khâsakhmouî are of a less
heavy workmanship and more nearly approach that of
later studios. That the ruins have rendered only a few
that possess worth does not prove that there may not
have been excellent ones: we must have patience and
wait till some happy chance belies the mediocrity.</p>

<p>The Memphian Empire has furnished thirteen plates,
and I doubt if they are enough. The number of masterpieces,
and especially of pieces which, without possessing
claims to perfection, offer interest on some count, is so
large that Bissing could easily have found, in the Cairo
Museum alone, material enough to double the number.
Very probably it was due to the publisher and a question
of economy: but all the same I regret the absence of
half a dozen statues that would have made a good appearance
by the side of the Scribe of the Berlin Museum.
The chief species of the period are at least represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
by very good examples: statues of the Pharaoh seated,
receiving homage, are represented by two of the Chephrên
of the Cairo Museum; of the Pharaoh standing, by the
Pioupi in bronze; those of private individuals standing
and isolated, or in groups, by the Cheîkh el-Beled of the
Gizeh Museum, by the Sapouî and the Nasi of the
Louvre, or by the pair at Munich; those of individuals
seated by the Scribe of Berlin and by one of the Readers
of Cairo. One of the Cairo statues, of mediocre workmanship,
is, however, curious, because it shows us a priest
completely nude, by no means usual, and circumcized, a
fact still less usual. Three fragments preserved at Munich,
portions of three stelæ, a complete stele from the Cairo
Museum, an episode borrowed from the tomb of Apouî,
of which Cairo possesses almost an entire wall, provide
specimens of bas-reliefs for the student to study, without,
however, permitting him to suspect the variety
of motives and abundance of detail usually met with in
the necropolises of Saqqarah or of Gizeh. Reduced to
these elements, Bissing’s book will make the impression
on its readers of a noble art exalted by inspiration, minute
and skilful in the material execution, but monotonous,
and confined in a rather narrow circle of concepts and
forms of expression. It is only fair to add that the book
is not finished and that, thanks to the system employed
of double and triple plates, it is quite easy to insert
new documents among those of the parts that have
already appeared. Some of the lacunæ will assuredly be
filled up, and the additions will place us in a better
position to judge the worth of the ancient Memphian
school.</p>

<p>The notices of the first Theban Empire are more
numerous, and they render it possible to study the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
history of statuary during the long interval that separates
the Heracleopolitan period from the domination of the
Shepherd Kings. For the XIth Dynasty, besides the
wonderful statue of Montouhotpou III, there are bas-reliefs
or paintings found at Gebeleîn in the ruins of a
temple of Montouhotpou I. Afterwards, we have, in the
XIIth Dynasty itself, the seated statues of Sanouosrît I,
of Nofrît and of Amenemhaît III, the sphinx of Amenemhaît
III that Mariette declared to be the portrait of a
Hyksôs king, an admirable king’s head preserved in the
Vienna Museum, and pieces of lesser interest, among
which a curious bas-relief of Sanouosrît I dancing before
the god Mînou at Coptos should be mentioned. For the
XIIIth and following Dynasties, I only see as yet the
Sovkhotpou of the Louvre, the barbarous head of Mît-Fares,
and the Sovkemsaouf of Vienna, but we must wait
for the next parts before deciding to what point Bissing
has made use of the rich store of documents available for
that period. The second Theban Empire, so rich in
souvenirs of all kinds, offered an embarrassing choice: the
Cairo Museum alone possesses material enough for two
or three volumes, especially since the fortunate excavations
conducted by Legrain at the <i>favissa</i> of Karnak.
The subjects in favour of which Bissing decided have
their special importance: they are each the actual head
of a pillar, the type of a series that he could, in many
cases, have reproduced almost entire, so well has chance
served us in the course of these last years. The statues
of Amenôthes, of Thoutmôsis, of the Ramses, of the Harmais
are celebrated, and it is unnecessary to enumerate
them one after the other: the reader will see them again
with pleasure as he goes along, and will admire the marvellous
skill with which the photographer has reproduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
them, and the printer has responded to the photographer’s
skill. The pictures of the volume are often perfect, and
plates like those of the head of one of the sphinxes of
Amenemhaît III are so successful that in looking at
them we have almost the sensation of the original. In a
few, however, the printing is too heavy and the thickness
of the ink has distorted and coarsened the modelling.
As a general rule the larger number of the defects I
have noted are due to this tiresome question of inks. I
know too well from my own experience the difficulties
caused by the obstinacy of the workmen on that point,
so I am able to make excuses for both Bruckmann and
Bissing.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>So much for the illustrations: the portion of the text
as yet published greatly increases their interest, and
assures the work permanent value. It contains information
as to the origin of the object, its migrations, its
actual home to-day, its state of preservation and, at need,
the restorations it has undergone: descriptions showing
careful research, and extended bibliographies complete the
suggestions made by the picture, and inform us of
previous criticisms. The shortest of the notices fills two
compact quarto columns, and are reinforced by numerous
footnotes; many of them are veritable essays in which
the subject is examined on every side and as exhaustively
as is possible. Vignettes are inserted which exhibit the
object in a different light from that of the plate, or show
the reader some of the analogous motives referred to in
the discussion.</p>

<p>Repetition of similar types has sometimes prevented
Bissing from developing his views as a whole, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
are compelled to look under several rubrics before learning
his full opinion. This is a serious drawback unless
it is remedied in the introduction: we shall perhaps find
all the observations brought together there into one system,
with justificatory references to each of the notices in
particular.</p>

<p>Bissing’s criticisms are always well justified: they
testify to a mature taste or a sure tact, and there are very
few with which experts would not willingly agree. Here
and there, however, I must make some reservations, for
example, with regard to the Chephrên of Gizeh. After
discussing at length Borchardt’s reasons for attributing
it to a Saïte school, and refuting them, Bissing declares
that it is perhaps a late copy of a work contemporary with
the Pharaoh. I recently had occasion to study it closely
in order to determine the position in the Museum best
suited to it, and to decide the height of the plinth on
which it should be placed. I went over Borchardt’s
arguments and Bissing’s hypotheses one after the other and
came to the conclusion that the date assigned by Mariette
at the moment of its discovery is the only admissible
one. The archæological details belong to the Memphian
age, and the peculiarities of style which Bissing points out,
and which actually exist, are not sufficiently strongly
marked to justify its attribution to a later epoch. I only
see in them the divergences which, in every age, mark
works coming from different and perhaps rival studios.
The artists who cut the <i>doubles</i> in diorite destined for
the pyramid of the Pharaoh, did not certainly have the
same masters as those to whom we owe the Chephrên
in alabaster and the royal statuettes of Mitrahineh:
the difference of origin sufficiently explains why they
do not resemble each other. I fear that in criticizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
certain sculptures Borchardt and others were governed
in spite of themselves by the ideas that long prevailed
on the uniformity and monotony of Egyptian art. It
seemed to them that at one and the same period the
composition and inspiration must always remain identical,
and wherever they did not harmonize, the fact was attributed
solely to an interval in time. But we must
accustom ourselves to think that things did not go
differently with the Egyptians than with the moderns.
In a city like Memphis there was more than one studio,
and they all possessed their traditions, their affectations,
their style, which distinguished them from each other,
and which are found in their work like a trade-mark.
Some errors of classification will be avoided in the future
if we can be persuaded to recognize that many of
the peculiarities that we begin to note on statues and
bas-reliefs may be the mannerisms of the school to
which they belong, and are not always indications of
relative age.</p>

<p>The care that Bissing has taken to render what is due to
each of the experts who discovered a piece or spoke of it,
deserves the more praise since many Egyptologists of the
present generation have adopted the attitude of ignoring
what has been said or written before them. They seem
to insinuate to their readers that archæology, religion,
grammar, history, nothing indeed that they touch on,
has ever been studied before, and that the bibliography
of a subject begins with the first essay they have devoted
to it. Although the past of Egyptology is so short, it is
a difficult subject to know, and it is not surprising if
Bissing has misrepresented some features or ignored others.
For example, he attributes the merit of recognizing in
the animal’s tail that the kings attach to their back, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
a lion’s tail but a jackal’s<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> to Wiedemann; I do not
know if I was the first, but I think that I certainly stated
this before Wiedemann.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> A little farther on, I regret
that Bissing was not acquainted with my notice of the
statue of Montouhotpou in the <i>Musée Egyptien</i>:<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> I am
curious to know if he accepts my explanation of the disproportion
between the feet, legs, and bust. It seems to
me that it was not intended to be on the same level
as the spectator, but that it ought to be placed in a
naos, on a fairly high platform which could be reached
by a staircase in front: seen from below, foreshortened,
the effect of the perspective would redeem the exaggeration
of form and re-establish the balance between the
parts. It seems also that Bissing was not acquainted
with the part of the <i>Musée</i> in which this Montouhotpou
is discussed, for he does not refer to it again with regard
to the Amenemhaît III discovered by Flinders Petrie
at Fayoum.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Farther on again, it would have been in
keeping to note that Legrain found the debris of a
statuette in black granite in the mud of the <i>favissa</i> at
Karnak, which so closely resembles the admirable Ramses
II of Turin that it might almost be the replica or a
sort of original rough model.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Unfortunately the head
is wanting, but we have been almost entirely successful
in restoring the body: if it is not by the same
sculptor who took such pleasure in modelling the Turin
statue, it comes from the same royal studio. The few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
differences to be noted between them arise solely from
the inequality of the stature: it was necessary to simplify
certain details or to suppress them in the smallest of
the statues.</p>

<p>These examples show that there is nothing very
serious in the omissions and negligences: we are surprised
not that there should be some, but that among
such a mass of references there are not more. I might
perhaps disagree with some of the theories or points
of doctrine Bissing constantly advances, but I will
wait to do so until he has elaborated into a system the
elements so abundantly spread through the notices. But
there is one criticism I will make now: he scarcely
mentions the schools into which Egypt was divided, so
that we are tempted to conclude that, like so many contemporary
archæologists, he believes in the existence of
one sole school, which worked in an almost uniform
manner over the whole of Egypt at one time. It is,
however, certain that there were always several schools
on the banks of the Nile, each of which possessed its
traditions, its designs, its method of interpreting the
costume or the pose of individuals, the works of which
have a sufficiently special physiognomy to admit of their
being easily separated into their different groups. Here,
again, it seems to me that sometimes varieties of execution
which are the result of the teaching are taken to
be signs of age, and that pieces which are contemporary
within a few years, but which proceed from distinct
schools, are spread over centuries. I have not discovered
Bissing in such errors: his natural insight and his knowledge
of the monuments preserved him from making
them. I wish, however, that he had touched on the
matter more definitely than he has, and, after letting it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
be seen in several places that he admits the existence of
those schools, he should have defined their characteristics
in accordance as the progress of his book brought their
work before the reader. He has briefly touched on the
matter in regard to the sphinxes of Tanis and the statue
of Amenemhaît III, but he might, for example, have
seized the opportunity of the Montouhotpou in order to
demonstrate the tendencies of Theban art at its birth; he
could have followed them in their evolution, and the
Amenôthes I of Turin might perhaps have served to
teach us how those tendencies were developed or modified
between the beginning of the first Theban Empire and
that of the second. A passage in the notice of the so-called
Hyksôs sphinxes leads me to hope that he will do
this for the Tanite school in regard to the celebrated
<i>Bearers of offerings</i>: I greatly wish that I may not be
disappointed in my hope.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>As far as I can judge there were at least four large
schools of sculpture in the valley of the Nile: at Memphis,
Thebes, Hermopolis, and in the eastern part of the
delta. I have attempted farther on to sketch the
history and define the principal characteristics of the
Theban school;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> I shall only refer to it as far as it is
necessary to make clear in what it is distinguished from
the three others.</p>

<p>And to begin with, it is probable that the first of
those in date, the Memphian, is merely the prolongation
and continuation of a previous Thinite school. If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
compare the few objects of real art that have come to
us from the Thinites with parallel works of which the
necropolises of Gizeh, Saqqarah and the Fayoum have
restored to us so many examples, I am struck by the
resemblances in inspiration and technique that exist
between the two. We have no statues originating from
Thinis itself, but the stelæ, the amulets in alto-relievo,
the fragments of minute furniture discovered in the tombs
of Omm-el-Gaâb find their exact counterpart in similar
pieces that come from the excavations of Abousîr-el-Malak
or of Meîdoum and from the sub-structure of
Memphian residences. I think I see that at the beginning
there were mediocre workmen in the plain of the
Pyramids capable, however, of sculpturing, ill or well, a
statue of a man seated or standing: to those men I
attribute the statue No. 1 in the Cairo Museum, the
Matonou (Amten) of Berlin, the Sapouî (Sepa) of the
Louvre, and a few other lesser ones. The same defects
are to be seen in all: the head out of proportion to
the body, the neck ungraceful, the shoulders high, the
bust summarily rough-hewn and without regard to the
dimensions of each part, the arms and legs heavy, thick,
angular. Their roughness and awkwardness compared
with the beautiful appearance of the two statues of
Meîdoum, which are almost contemporary with them,
would astonish us if we did not think that the latter,
commissioned for relatives of Sanofraouî, proceed from
the royal workshops. The transference of the capital to
Memphis, or rather to the district stretching from the
entrance into the Fayoum to the fork of the delta,
necessarily resulted in impoverishing Thinis-Abydos; the
stone-cutters, architects, statuaries, and masons accompanied
the court, and planted the traditions and teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
of their respective fatherlands in their new homes.
According to what is seen in the tombs of Meîdoum,
the latest Thinite style, or rather the transition style of
the IIIrd Dynasty, presents exactly the same characteristics
as the perfect style of the IVth, Vth, and VIth
Dynasties, but with a less stiff manner. The pose of the
persons and the silhouettes of the animals are already
schematized and encircled in the lines which will enclose
them almost to the end of Egyptian civilization, but the
detail is freer, and keeps very close to reality. The
tendency is perceived only in the roundness and suppleness
that prevails from the time of Cheops and Chephrên.
The Memphites sought to idealize their models rather
than to make a faithful copy of them, and while respecting
the general resemblance, desired to give the
spectator an impression of calm majesty or of gentleness.
Their manner was adopted at Thinis by a counter-shock,
and it may be said that from the IVth to the XXVIth
Dynasty Abydos remained almost a branch of the
Memphian school, which, however, grew out of it. The
productions only differ from those of the Memphites in
subordinate points, except during the XIXth Dynasty,
when Setouî I and Ramses II summoned Theban
sculptors there, and for some years it became, artistically,
a fief of Thebes.</p>

<p>If we would indicate in one word the character of this
Thinito-Memphian art, we should say that it resides in
an idealism of convention as opposed to the realism of
Theban art. Thanks to the fluctuations of political life
which alternately made Memphis and Thebes the capitals
of the whole kingdom, the æsthetics of the two cities
spread to the neighbouring towns, and did not allow
them to form an independent art: Heracleopolis, Beni-Hassan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Assiout, Abydos took after Memphis, while the
Saîd and Nubia, from Denderah to Napata, remained
under the jurisdiction of Thebes. An original school
arose, however, in one place, and persisted for a fairly
long time, in Hermopolis Magna, the city of Thot. We
observe there, from the end of the Ancient Empire, sculptors
who devoted themselves to expressing with a scrupulous
naturalism, and often with an intentional seeking after ugliness,
the bearing of individuals and the movement of groups.
We should observe with what humour they interpreted
the extremes of obesity and emaciation in man and beast,
in the two tombs called <i>the fat and the lean</i>. The region
where they flourished is so little explored that it is still
unknown how long their activity practised a continuous
style: it was at its best under the first Theban Empire,
at Bercheh, at Beni-Hassan, at Cheîkh-Saîd, but the period
at which it seems to me to be most in evidence was at the
end of the XVIIIth Dynasty, under the heretic Pharaohs.
When Amenôthes IV founded his capital of Khouîtatonou,
if, as is probable, he settled some Theban masters there, he
would certainly have utilized the studios of Hermopolis.
The scenes engraved on the tombs of El-Tell and El-Amarna
are due to the same spirit and the same teaching as those
of the <i>fat and lean</i> tombs; there are similar deformations
of the human figure bordering on caricature, the
same suppleness and sometimes the same violence in
the gestures and attitudes. In a number of portraits the
Theban importation prevails, but the cavalcades, processions,
royal audiences, popular scenes, must be attributed
to the Hermopolitans, for their inspiration and execution
present so striking a contrast to those of analogous
pictures that adorn the walls of Louxor or Karnak. The
fall of the little Atonian Dynasty stopped their activity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
deprived of the vast commissions which opened a new field
for their enterprise, they fell back into their provincial
routine, and we have not yet enough documents to tell us
what their successors became in the course of the centuries.</p>

<p>In the delta two fairly different styles may be seen
from the beginning. In the east, at Tanis and in its
neighbourhood, there is, at the beginning of the first
Theban Empire, a veritable school, the productions of
which possess such an individual physiognomy that
Mariette did not hesitate to attribute them to the
Shepherd Kings: since the works of Golenischeff it is
known that the so-called Hyksôs sphinxes are of
Amenemhaît III, and that they belong to the second
half of the XIIth Dynasty. This Tanite school is perpetuated
through the ages; it was still flourishing under
the XXIst and XXIInd Dynasties, as is proved by the
fine group of bearers of offerings in the Cairo Museum.
The predominant features are the energy and harshness
of the modelling, especially of the human face: its
masters have copied a type, and modes of coiffure belonging,
as Mariette formerly pointed out, to the half-savage
populations of Lake Menzaleh, the <i>Egyptians in the
marshes</i> of Herodotus. It seems to me that their manner
is still to be noted in the Græco-Roman period in the
statues of princes and priests that we have in the Cairo
Museum: the technical skill, however, is less than in the
sphinxes and the bearers of offerings. The centre and
west of the delta, on the other hand, came under the
influence of Memphis, as far as we can judge from
the rare existing fragments belonging to the Ancient
Empire. Under the Thebans the dependence is clear,
and all that comes from those regions differs in nothing
from what we have from the Memphian necropolises.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Only in the Ethiopian period, and under the influence
of the successors of Bocchoris, is a Saïte school revealed
to us, which, borrowing its general composition from the
Memphian school, comes closer to nature and impresses
an individual stamp on certain elements of the human
figure that until then had been handled in a loose, so to
say, an abstract fashion. The modelling of the face is as
full of expression as in the fine works of the Theban
school, but with greater finish and less harsh effects; the
ravages of old age, wrinkles, crows’-feet, flabbiness of
flesh, thinness, are all reproduced with a care unusual in
preceding generations; the skull, indeed, is so minute in
detail that it might almost be called an anatomical study.
This impulse towards skilled realism, begun by instinct in
the heart of the school, became accentuated and accelerated
by contact with the Hellenes, who from the time of
Psammetichus I swarmed in the provinces of the delta.
Certain bas-reliefs of Alexandria and Cairo, the date of
which is assigned to the reign of Nectanebo II, which
I should like to place in that of one of the first Ptolemies,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
may be regarded as extant witnesses of a kind of composite
art analogous to that which was developed two
centuries later at Alexandria or at Memphis, and of
which the Cairo Museum possesses some rare examples.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that I do not claim
to put the complete result of my study of the schools,
the presence of which in Ancient Egypt is now confirmed,
in these few lines. I am only anxious to point
out the part played by them in historic times, and the
errors into which those who have written the history of
Egyptian art without suspecting their existence, or without
taking into consideration what we do know of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
have fallen. Bissing does not ignore them, and is doubtless
waiting to criticize them in his Introduction. He has
so much material that it will be easy for him to rectify
my hypotheses, and to confirm them where necessary;
in that way his book will gain by being no longer a mere
collection of monuments each described as an isolated
piece, but a veritable treatise on sculpture, or at least on
Egyptian statuary.</p>

<p>I shall be sincerely sorry if he fails in that particular,
but even so, I should feel it right to declare that he has come
honourably out of an enterprise in which he had no predecessors.
The few plates that I inserted a quarter of a century
ago in the <i>Monuments de l’Art Antique</i>, and the notices
contained in the parts of the <i>Musée Egyptien</i> that have
already appeared, afforded both experts and amateurs a
foretaste of the surprises that Egypt has in store in the
matter of art; they have been too few, and have related
to subjects too scattered in point of time, to produce a
body of doctrine. But here, on the contrary, nearly two
hundred pieces are available, classified according to the
order of the Dynasties, and for the most part unpublished,
or better reproduced than in the past. Each will be
accompanied by an analysis in which the researches previously
connected with it will be set forth and discussed;
for the first time Egyptologists and the general public
will have the artistic and critical apparatus required for
judging the value of the principal pieces of Egyptian
statuary before their eyes and in their hands. Those who
know the amount of the literature existing on Egyptology,
and how scattered it is, can easily imagine the patience
and bibliographical <i>flair</i> that Bissing must have needed
for gathering from libraries the information so generously
scattered on every page of his notices. But that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
only the least part of his task; the appreciation of the
objects themselves demanded of him an ever alert attention
and a continuous tension of mind which would
promptly have exhausted a man less devoted to the
minutiæ of artistic observation. In other branches of the
science, the materials have for the most part been so often
and so repeatedly kneaded that nearly always half of the
work has been already done; here, nothing of that sort exists,
and in many cases Bissing has dealt with objects that he
was the first to know, and of which no previous study
had been attempted. That he is sometimes weary, and
that here and there his opinions may be controverted, he
willingly confesses. But what surprises me is how very
rarely it is necessary to upset them, even partially.</p>

<p>I hope then that we shall not have to wait too long
for the completion of this admirable work. May I venture
to add that after the present edition, which is an
<i>édition de luxe</i>, a popular edition would be welcome?
Egyptologists like myself are condemned to pay such large
sums for our books that the price of these “Denkmäler”
does not alarm us, but the fact has greater importance
for others. A reproduction in a smaller <i>format</i>, and less
expensive, would greatly help to spread the knowledge
of Egyptian art among classes of readers whom the book
in its present form will not reach.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> has long been a debatable question if the Egyptian
statues of kings and private individuals can be regarded as
faithful portraits or as merely approximate to their originals.
No one has ever denied that their authors desired to make
them as like as possible, but we hesitate to believe that they
succeeded in doing so. The air of uniformity lent them by
the repeated employment of the same expressions and
the same postures encouraged the notion that, judging
themselves incapable of exactly transcribing the details of
bodily form or physiognomy proper to each individual, the
sculptors decided that such details were not necessary for
the kind of service to which the statues were destined: they
considered that the task entrusted to them was sufficiently
fulfilled if the soul or the <i>double</i> for which these statues
provided an imperishable body recognized in them
enough of the perishable body to enable them to attach
themselves to it without hurt in the course of their
posthumous existence. The study of the monuments has
dissipated those doubts. Any one who has carefully handled
one of the Saïte heads, the skull and face of which present
such clearly individual characteristics, must acknowledge
that so many details noted with such felicitous care indicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
an absolute intention of transmitting the exact appearance
of the model to posterity. And if, proceeding forward, we
reach the second Theban period, we shall soon, thanks to
the chances which have delivered to us the well-preserved
corpses of about fifty princes and princesses, recognize the
success with which the royal studios perpetuated in stone
the effigies of their contemporaries. The profile of Setouî I
photographed in his coffin would coincide line for line with
that of his bas-reliefs of Karnak or Abydos were it not for
the thinness resulting from embalmment. Let us go back
eight or ten centuries and see how the master sculptors of
the first Theban period treated their Pharaohs. The statues
of Amenemhaît III and of Sanouosrît have so personal a
note that we should be wrong to imagine they could be
anything but a sincere, almost a brutal likeness. The two
Chephrên of the Cairo Museum were not long ago alone in
suggesting to us the conviction that the Memphian times
yielded nothing in this matter of resemblance to ages farther
removed from us; the recent discovery of ten statues of
Mycerinus prevents any further doubt.</p>

<p>Most of them have not left Egypt. The first that came
to us was acquired by purchase in 1888, with four statuettes
of Naousirrîya, of Mankahorou, of Chephrên, and perhaps
of Cheops. According to the information collected at the
time by Grébaut, they were found together, two or three
weeks before, by fellahs of Mît-Rahineh under the ruins
of a little brick building situated at the east of what was
formerly the sacred lake of the temple of Phtah at
Memphis. That was certainly not their original place;
they had probably each adorned first the funerary chapel
annexed to the pyramid of its sovereign: their transference
to the town and their reunion in the place where they were
discovered are not earlier than the reign of the last Saïtes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
or the first Ptolemies. It was then, in fact, that hatred of
foreign domination having exalted the love of all that was
peculiarly Egyptian in the eyes of the people, reverence for
the glorious Pharaohs of former ages revived: their priesthoods
were reorganized, and they again received the worship
to which centuries of neglect had disaccustomed them.
None of our figures are life-size, and the Mycerinus in
diorite, which is not one of the smallest, is scarcely 21⅛ inches
in height. It is enthroned on a cubical block with the
impassibility that the Chephrên has made familiar to us;
the bust is stiff, the arms rest on the thighs, he looks straight
before him, his face expressionless, as was imposed on
Pharaoh by etiquette, while the crowd of courtiers and
vassals filed past at his feet: if his name, engraved on the
sides of his seat to the right and left of his legs, had not told
who he was, we should have guessed it from his bearing.
The composition, although not the best imaginable, is
good: but the head makes a poor effect in relation to the
torso, a defect always at first ascribed to the heedlessness of
the sculptor. But it is to be noted that the face somewhat
recalled that of two of the other Pharaohs, a fact to be
explained by the relationship, the second, Chephrên, being
the father of Mycerinus, and the third, probably Cheops,
his grandfather. That is a reason for presuming that they
are portraits, but are they authentic portraits? Several
Berlin Egyptologists whose natural ingenuity encouraged
them to revise Mariette’s criticisms on art, thought to discern
in certain details of the costume and ornamentation a
proof that if they were not figures of pure imagination, they
were at least copies of ancient originals freely executed
under one of the Saïte Dynasties, and their theory, although
opposed by experts who had a longer experience, disconcerted
the majority. It was soon upset by facts, but, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
often happens, the consequences deduced from it survived
by force of habit. Many of us feared for some years after
to be asserting too much, to declare openly that our
Mycerinus was what we had entitled him on the faith of
his inscription, the real Mycerinus.</p>

<p>Alabaster. Cairo Museum.</p></div></div>

<p>We did not do so until 1908, when Reisner and his
Americans, excavating at Gizeh round about the third
pyramid, brought to light monuments that with the best
will in the world no one could assign to any other epoch
than that of Mycerinus. It seems that the fame of piety
which popular story ascribed to him was not wholly
unmerited, at least as far as his own divinity is concerned,
for with the elements of a voluminous funerary equipment
in all kinds of stones, the workmen brought out of the ruins
of the chapel, fragments of a multitude of statues in alabaster,
schist, limestone, and rare breccia. Among them were
some unfinished or scarcely shaped out, for the sovereign
having died while they were being fashioned, the works,
according to Oriental custom, had been immediately
interrupted and the workshops abandoned in confusion.</p>

<p>The statues which were already finished and set up
in their places were overturned at some unknown period,
perhaps when Saladin dismantled the pyramids to build
the new ramparts and citadel of Cairo, and the fragments
were so ill-treated that an enormous number of them
have disappeared. Out of a hundred baskets of debris
collected by the Americans, they found at most, besides
five or six intact heads, enough to put together, almost
completely, two alabaster statues. The best of the heads
is in the Cairo Museum, and it has sufficient resemblance
to our statuette for us to have no hesitation in recognizing
Mycerinus, even if the place whence it comes
did not help us to guess it. The statue that the find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
brought us is seated, but the block on which it is sculptured
is not perpendicular to its base, so that it leans slightly
backward. On the other hand, the two arms being cut
between the armpit and the hip, the accident makes it
appear at first glance as if the bust is too narrow for its
height. But, and this is the important point, the head is
small, so small that the head-dress, in spite of its size, is
not sufficient to correct the bad effect of this disproportion
between its smallness and the amplitude of the
shoulders. The fault is not to be ascribed to the artist’s
ignorance and lack of skill, as is probably done. He was
not, it must be admitted, a man of talent, but he knew
his business, and proved it by the general quality of his
work. The harmony between the trunk and the leg, the
muscles of the chest, the texture of the costume, the
modelling of the knee and calf, conform to the æsthetics
of the time; the foot and ankle are particularized with
the virtuosity of a craftsman skilled in all the subtleties
of his calling. So, now, returning to the statuette of
Mît-Rahineh, the technique of which shows it to proceed not
from a different school but from a different studio, we
shall find a difficulty in imagining that two sculptors
would each have fallen into so great an error, if they had
not seen it themselves in their model. Since their statues
are microcephalous, Mycerinus must have been microcephalous
almost to deformity.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>ALABASTER STATUE OF MYCERINUS.</p>

<p>Cairo Museum.</p></div></div>

<p>The search among the beds of fragments of stone was
continued. A few weeks before it was finished, at the
end of May, 1908, it produced four groups in schist, the
testimony of which fully confirmed that of the alabaster
statues. The disposition is the same, with very slight
divergences, which do not sensibly modify the aspect of
the pieces. Three persons stand side by side against a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
slab 17 to 23 inches high. Mycerinus is in the middle,
his left foot advanced, the waist-cloth fluted on the loins,
and on his forehead the white cap of the kingdom of
Upper Egypt. He always has a goddess on his right, a
Hathor moulded in the sleeveless smock open on the
chest, and on her hair the short wig and the <i>coufieh</i>.
On the top of this head-dress she wears her two cow’s
horns and the solar disk. In one of the groups she is
walking, her arms hanging down and her hands laid flat
on her thighs; in the second, she embraces him with her
left arm and presses against him; in the third she holds
his right hand in her left. The last of the figures is
sometimes a woman, sometimes a man: the man, who is
shorter by a third than his companions, walks forward
swinging his arms; the two women are at rest, and one of
them puts her right arm round the king’s waist, in
symmetry with the Hathor on the left. They are
geographical entities, nomes, and the standards on their
heads tell us their names: the two women personify the
nomes of Sistrum and the Dog, the man that of
Oxyrrhinchus. The fragments of schist under which
they were buried assuredly belong to other groups now
destroyed, but how many of them were there in the
beginning? The decorative theme of which they formed
part is one of which the intention is grasped at the first
glance, but if we needed a commentary to explain it, the
brief legends at the base would provide the material. They
inform us, in fact, that our Hathor is the lady of the
Canton of the Sycomore, and that the nome of the Dog,
that of the Sistrum, that of Oxyrrhinchus, bring the
sovereign all the good things of their territory. Mycerinus,
in his quality of king of the Saîd and of the delta, had a
right to tribute during his life, and to offerings after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
death from the whole country, and on the other hand,
Hathor, lady of the Sycomore, is the patron of dead
Osirians in the Memphian province where the palaces
and tombs of the Pharaohs are. It was natural then
that she should serve as the introducer of the delegates
of the nomes when they came to pay their tribute to
the common master. With rich private individuals, the
operation was symbolized on the walls of the funerary
chapels by long processions of men or women in bas-relief,
each of whom incarnated one of the domains
charged with the upkeep of the tomb. Here it was
expressed in even a more concrete fashion by two series
of groups in rondo-bosso, which were probably developed
on the walls in one of the court-yards of the temple of
the pyramid. The four which have escaped destruction
belonged to the series of the Saîd, as is proved by their
names and the head-dress of the sovereign, but those of
the delta could not have been omitted without causing
regrettable privations to the <i>double</i> in his life beyond
the tomb; there were then about forty in all, as many
as there were nomes in the whole of Egypt.</p>

<p class="clear">The excellence of those that have survived fills us
with regret for those that are lost. At the instant they
emerged from the earth, they preserved something of
their primitive colouring, but contact with the air and
light speedily deprived them of it, and only traces remain
on the chest, at the neck, wrists, waist, places
protected by the customary ornaments of people of high
rank. The gold-leaf with which the necklaces and
bracelets were decorated was stolen in times of antiquity,
but the thicker layers of paint on which they were
placed preserve their contours fairly exactly. It would
be easy for us to restore to the whole the aspect it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
when fresh and new—a light yellow complexion for the
women, and red-brown for the men, black hair, blue or
white head-dresses, white crowns, and garments relieved
by the tawny brilliance of the jewels. In pieces where
everything is so minutely calculated for reality, it is
scarcely probable that anything is the effect of chance
or of lack of skill; if then the sovereign’s head is too
small it is because it was so in reality. In fact, the lack
of proportion with the rest of the body is less perceptible
here than in the isolated statues, and it is not perceptible
at the first glance: but it is soon recognized when
the sovereign is compared with his two companions. Not
only are their heads larger and more massive than his,
but it would seem that the sculptor desired to accentuate
the inequality between them by a trick of his craft: he
has perceptibly narrowed their shoulders, and the contrast
between the small head that surmounts the vast shoulders
of Mycerinus with the two large heads that weight the
narrow shoulders of the acolytes, emphasizes the deformity
that the placing together of three figures on the
same level had almost concealed. Study of the schists
leads to the same conclusion as that formed of the
alabasters. It is the real Mycerinus that contemporaries
have bound themselves to transmit to posterity, and they
have spared no details which were naturally calculated
to make us better acquainted with him. We have only
to analyse their works to see him stand before us in his
habit as he lived. He was tall, robust, slender, with
long legs, powerful shoulders surmounted by a small
face, an athlete with the head almost of a child. In
addition, projecting eyes, big ears, a short nose, the tip
turned up, a sensual mouth with full lips, a chin
receding under the artificial beard; the expression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
face is benevolent, even weak. In vain has the sculptor
stiffened the backbone and the neck, thrown out the
chest, stretched the biceps, clenched the fist, and immobilized
the features into a hieratic gravity: he has
not succeeded in inculcating the sovereign majesty that
makes our Chephrên the ideal Pharaoh, the equal of
the gods. He has the sanctimonious appearance of a
private individual of good family, but his general bearing
is below his condition. We could easily point to a dozen
statues, his neighbours in the Cairo Museum, that of
Rânafir, for instance, which have a more exalted appearance
and a prouder mien.</p>

<p>And the new schist group that Reisner discovered
during the winter of 1909 has not made any change in
our opinion necessary. This time Mycerinus is represented
with his wife; the lower portions of the two
figures had not received the final polish when death
intervened, but those of the upper part were finished
and are admirable. Mycerinus wears the head-dress of
the ordinary <i>claft</i>, which squarely frames the face, and
his features are those with which we have become
familiar in the statues described above; eyes starting
from his head, a fixed expression, turned up nose, a
large, loose mouth, the lower lip protruding, the
physiognomy of a man of the middle class straining
to appear dignified. The queen does not appear much
more noble, but in looking at her we are disposed to
think that she had more intelligence and vivacity.
We should not say that she was exactly smiling,
but a smile has just passed over her face, and traces
of it remain on her lips and in her eyes. She has
beautiful round cheeks, a little turned-up nose, a full
chin, full lips cleft from top to bottom by a strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
marked furrow: a determined expression shows itself
between her narrow, heavy eyelids. She resembles her
husband, a fact that is not surprising, since unions
between brothers and sisters were not only tolerated
but commanded by custom; there is thus every chance
that the couple were born of the same father and
mother; she has only a greater appearance of strength
than he has. Custom exacted that, when a husband
and wife were associated in a group, they should not
be placed side by side on a level of absolute equality,
but that the woman should be given a posture or
merely a gesture implying a state of more or less
affectionate dependence on the husband; she crouched
at his feet, her chest against his knees, or her arm was
round his waist or his neck, as if she had no trust
except in his protection. Here the queen’s gesture is
in conformity with convention, but the manner of its
execution contradicts the intention of submission: she
leans less against the Pharaoh than she draws him close
to her, and looks as if she is protecting him at least as
much as he is protecting her. She is his equal in
height, and even if she is more slender than he is, as is
proper to her sex, her shoulders are as robust. Does it
mean that the sculptor has attributed to her the massive
shoulders of a man? Not at all: but following the
example of his colleagues in the triads, he has cheated
a little in order to dissimulate the defect of his model.
As doubtless he would not have liked to show a deformed
Pharaoh, and as he might not alter features
which, after all, were those of a god, he has made the
deformity less visible by taking away from the shoulders
what was wanted in order to establish a sort of apparent
equilibrium between the parts, and so we are brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
back by a fresh detour to the point to which the examination
of the alabasters and triads had led us. Let us
once more conclude that the effigies of the Memphian
Pharaohs and their subjects were real portraits of the
personages they claimed to reproduce.</p>

<p>They were real, but not realistic unless there was special
necessity. I have repeatedly attempted to define the two
chief schools of Egyptian sculpture, the Theban and the
Memphian. From the beginning the Theban school tends
to copy the model brutally, as it was at the moment when
it was portrayed. Take the statues of Sanouosrît I or of
Sanouosrît III, which lately came to the Cairo Museum.
The family likeness between all of them is indubitable,
but, according as they come from a Theban or Memphian
studio, the features which constitute the complete resemblance
are noted in such divergent ways that at the
first glance we are inclined to think that it scarcely exists.
The Thebans scrupulously marked the thinness of the
cheeks, the hardness of the eye, the harshness of the mouth,
the heaviness of the jaw, and have exaggerated rather than
diminished those points. The Memphians do not neglect
them, but have treated them in a more merciful manner,
and, from the haggard faces in which the rival school took
pleasure, have brought out the happy smiling expression
that its own traditions ascribed without exception to all
the Pharaohs. We cannot institute comparisons of that
kind for the epoch of Mycerinus: the Theban school, if,
as is probable, it was then in existence, still sleeps buried
beneath the ruins, and we know nothing belonging to it
to place by the side of the Memphian. It is sufficient,
however, to walk through the rooms of the Cairo Museum
reserved for it to be convinced that if the Cheîkh-el-Beled,
the Chephrên statues, the royal couple of Meîdoum, the
Rânafir statues are portraits and likenesses, they are at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
same time idealized portraits according to the formula,
the influence of which we have seen in the monuments of
the XIIth Dynasty. Whatever the models presented that
was too pronounced, was softened in order to give them the
serene bearing fitting the imperishable bodies of such noble
and respectable persons. They only departed from this
routine when there were monstrosities, the entire suppression
of which would have been fraught with danger for the
immortality of the subject, as in the case of the two dwarfs
in the Cairo Museum; but it is not quite certain if even
in those cases some modification of the ugliness has not
been contrived. What has happened to Mycerinus renders
it probable: have we not seen, in fact, that the artist
exerted his ingenuity to dissimulate the disturbing exiguity
of the head by an artifice? And he must often have
taken similar liberties, although we have no actual means
of proving it. I will venture to assert it of Chephrên,
although almost the half of one of his two statues, that
in green serpentine, is a restoration by Vassalli. For if
we compare their profiles, we notice that that of the
serpentine statue is weaker than that of the diorite statue:
the eye is smaller and the chin less authoritative, the tip
of the nose recedes a little, and there is a slight resemblance
with Mycerinus. The lofty dignity which I noted just
now as appearing in the father in contrast to the son may
be the result of the Memphians’ determination to idealize
their subjects so as to make each of them an almost abstract
type of the class to which they belonged.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the alabasters of Mycerinus
are a long way from equalling the schists. Indeed,
whenever we find statues of a person in different materials,
it is seldom that those most difficult to work in are not
also the best. Petrie concluded that in all periods Egypt
had a school of sculpture in limestone and soft stones,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and one in granite and hard stones. But who would
think of classifying modern sculptors in different schools
according as they used bronze or marble? In Egypt, as
in later times, the instruction given to learners prepared
them to practise the complete calling, whatever the
special branch to which they later confined themselves
might be, but as the handling of certain stones required
a more extended practice, care was taken in the workshops
to entrust them to the most expert. That is evidently
what happened in the case of Mycerinus. His alabasters
are certainly very estimable; but those to whom we owe
them were not skilled virtuosi, and if they acquitted
themselves of their task honourably, they only produced
ordinary work. Those who executed the schists were
much more skilled. I will not venture to assert that
they entirely triumphed over their material: the bodies
of princes and gods sculptured in matter so unyielding
and of so gloomy a tone present a rigidity of contour
which we feel as keenly as we do the lack of colour
which would enliven them. They almost repel any one
who sees them for the first time, but the repulsion once
overcome, they reveal themselves as perfect of their kind.
The artist has done what he wished with the ungrateful
material, and has handled it with the same suppleness as
if he had been kneading the most ductile clay. The
women are especially remarkable with their full round
shoulders, their small breasts placed low, the belly strong
and well designed, the thighs full and graceful, the legs
vigorous, one of the most elegant types created by
Memphian Egypt. It does not equal the diorite Chephrên,
nor the Cheîkh-el-Beled, nor the Crouching Scribe, nor
the lady of Meîdoum, but it is not so far removed from
them, and few pieces take so high a rank in the work of
the old Memphian school.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> inventories give no indication of the origin of
this head. So little was its source suspected that for a
long time it was believed to be of Peruvian work: M. de
Longpérier with his usual tact restored it to its rightful
place in the Egyptian series.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> At the first glance
the style is seen to be that of the ancient Memphian
Empire: it has evidently been detached from a statue found
in one of the necropolises of Saqqarah. The absence of
the plinth and the parts which usually bear the inscription
prevents us from knowing the name of the individual
it represents, a scribe contemporary, or very nearly, with the
celebrated Crouching Scribe. A narrow and somewhat
receding forehead, a long prominent eye slightly drawn
up towards the temples, snub-nose, thin nostrils, accentuated
cheekbones, thin cheeks, large mouth with full
lips, a firm rounded chin, do not make a flattering portrait
but certainly an exact one. The material is the excellent
limestone of Tourah painted bright red: the technique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
shows delicacy and skill rare even at that period of
admirable artists.</p>

<p>Almost all the statues of mere private individuals
come from temples or tombs. The right of setting
up a statue in the temples belonged exclusively
to the king; so the greater number of those we have
offer a special formula: “<i>Granted as a favour</i> on the
part of the king to a son of so and so,”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> sometimes too
the favour is qualified as <i>great</i> or <i>very great</i>. It was
then by some exceptional title, in reward of services
rendered, or by a caprice of royalty, that an Egyptian
was authorized to place his portrait in a temple, whether
of his native city or of some other town, to the god for
whom he professed a special devotion. The great feudal
lords, who all more or less aspired to possess royal rights,
sometimes took the liberty of setting up a statue of
themselves without the preliminary permission of Pharaoh;
but in spite of these usurpations of the royal prerogative,
the number is relatively small. Civil wars, foreign invasions,
the ruin of towns, the destruction of idols by the
Christians, contributed to make private statues coming
from temples rare in our museums.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>But, on the other hand, those that come from cemeteries
are very numerous. Every tomb that was somewhat
cared for in the ancient or new empire contained several
which represented the defunct alone, or accompanied by
the principal members of his family. They were not
always placed in the same spot: in the IVth Dynasty
they were sometimes placed in the outer court, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
open air, sometimes also in the chapel, where on certain
days the family celebrated the worship of the ancestor.
Most often they were imprisoned in a narrow chamber,
with a lofty ceiling, something like a corridor, and for
that reason called <i>Serdâb</i> by the Arabs. Sometimes the
<i>Serdâb</i> is lost in the masonry and does not communicate
with any of the other chambers. Sometimes it is connected
with the funerary chapel by a sort of quadrangular
pipe, so small that a hand can scarcely be inserted.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
The priests would burn incense near the orifice, pour
libations, present offerings, murmur prayers, and everything
was supposed to penetrate to the little apartment.
Some of these <i>Serdâb</i> contained one or two statues at
most, others would contain twenty. Some are in wood
or hard stone, but the greater number are in painted
limestone. Seated or standing, crouching or in the
attitude of walking, they all claim to be portraits—portraits
of the dead man, of his wife, of his children, of his
servants. If they were more often found in places where
they would have been visible, their presence would be
explained by the pleasure members of a family would
feel in seeing the features of those they had loved. But
they are generally walled up for all eternity in hidden
corners where no one would ever penetrate: we must
seek other reasons.</p>

<p>The Egyptians formed a somewhat coarse idea of
the human soul. They regarded it as an exact reproduction
of the body of each individual, formed of a substance
less dense than flesh and bones, but susceptible to the
sight, feeling, and touch. The <i>double</i>, or to call it by the
name they gave it, the <i>ka</i>, was subject, though in a lesser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
degree than its terrestrial type, to all the infirmities of
our life: it drank, ate, clothed itself, anointed itself with
perfumes, came and went in its tomb, required furniture, a
house, servants, an income. A man must be assured beyond
the tomb of the possession of all the wealth he had enjoyed
in the world, under penalty of being condemned
to an eternity of unspeakable misery. His family’s first
obligation towards him was to provide him with a durable
body; they therefore mummified his mortal remains to
the best of their ability, and buried the mummy at the
bottom of a pit where it could only be reached with the
greatest difficulty. The body, however, in spite of the
care taken in preparing it, only very remotely recalled
the form of the living person. It was, besides, unique
and easily destroyed: it could be broken, methodically
dismembered, and the pieces scattered or burnt. If it
disappeared, what would become of the <i>double</i>? For its
support statues were provided, representing the exact
form of the individual. Effigies in wood, limestone, hard
stone, bronze, were more solid than the mummy, and
there was nothing to prevent the manufacture of any number
of them desired. One body was a single chance of
durability for the <i>double</i>: twenty gave it twenty chances.
And that is the explanation of the astonishing number
of statues sometimes found in one tomb. The piety of
the relatives multiplied the images, and consequently the
supports, the imperishable bodies, of the <i>double</i> would,
by themselves alone, almost assure him immortality.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Both in the temples and hypogeums, the statues of
private persons were intended to serve as a support to
the soul. The consecration they received animated them,
so to speak, and made them substitutes for the defunct:
the offerings destined for the other world were served to
them. The tomb of a rich man possessed a veritable
chapel to which a special body of priests was attached,
formed of <i>hon-ka</i> or <i>priests of the double</i>. At the sacramental
festivals the <i>priests of the double</i> performed the
necessary rites, they looked after the upkeep of the
edifice and administered its revenues. The statues of
the towns themselves demanded particular care. Indeed,
the clergy of the temple in which they were placed claimed
their part in the advantages derived from ancestor worship:
veritable acts of donation were drawn up in their favour,
in which were specified the part they were to play in
the ceremonies, the quantity of the offerings that fell to
their share for the service rendered, the number of days
in the year consecrated to each statue. “Agreement
between Prince Hapi-T’aufi and the <i>hour-priests</i> of the
temple of Anubis, master of Siout, in regard to one
white loaf that each must give to the statue of the
prince, under the hand of the <i>ka-priest</i>, the 18th Thot,
the day of the festival of <i>Ouaga</i>,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and also the gifts
which every tomb owes to its lord; afterwards in regard
to the ceremony of kindling the flame, and the procession
that they ought to make with the <i>ka-priest</i> while he
celebrates the service in honour of the defunct, and that
they march to the north corner of the temple on the day
of kindling the flame. For that Hapi-T’aufi gives the
<i>hour-priests</i> a bushel of corn from each of the fields
belonging to the tomb, the firstfruits of the harvest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
of the prince’s domain, as each commoner in Siout is
accustomed to do from the firstfruits of his harvest,
for every peasant always makes a gift from the firstfruits
of his harvest to the temple.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The ceremonial is
set out in detail, and the monument tells us how, and
under what conditions, a dead person is fed in Egypt.
The loaves, meat and corn were placed in front of the
statue by the priests: thence they reached the gods, who,
after taking their part, transmitted the rest to the <i>double</i>.</p>

<p>We now understand why the statues that do not
represent gods are always and uniquely portraits as exact
as the artists could render them. Each was a stone body;
not an ideal body in which only beauty of form or expression
was sought, but a real body in which care should
be taken neither to add nor take away anything. If the
body of flesh had been ugly, the body of stone must be
ugly in the same way, otherwise the <i>double</i> would not
find the support it needed. The statue from which the
head preserved in the Louvre was broken off was, undoubtedly,
the faithful portrait of the individual whose
name was engraved on it: if the realism of the expression
is somewhat brutal, it is the fault of the model, who had
not taken care to be handsome, and not that of the
sculptor, who would have been guilty of a sort of impiety
if he had altered the physiognomy of his model in the
least detail.</p>

<span class="subhead">SKHEMKA, HIS WIFE AND SON<br />

<span class="subhead">A GROUP FOUND AT MEMPHIS<br />

(<i>The Louvre</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Skhemka</span> lived at Memphis at the end of the Vth
Dynasty. He was attached to the administration of the
domains, and was buried in the necropolis of Saqqarah.
His tomb, discovered by Mariette during the excavations
of the Serapeum, furnished three pretty statues to the
Louvre.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> I knew the group reproduced here at a time
when the coating that covered it had suffered very little;
the galleries of Europe possess nothing to be compared
with it for finish of execution.</p>

<p>I shall not say much of the principal personage: he
possesses all the qualities and all the defects to which
we are accustomed in the work of the sculptors of the
Ancient Empire. The modelling of the torso, arms, and
legs is excellent, of the foot mediocre, of the hands
execrable; the head lives, alive and intelligent under the
large wig, with its rows of braids one above the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
which frames it. The two accessory statues are charming
in design and composition. On the left Ati, the dead
man’s wife, stands leaning against the back of the seat
embracing her husband’s leg. The face and limbs are
painted yellow in accordance with a convention almost
always respected in Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> A layer of bright red denotes
the tan that the sun lays on the men’s skin; the light
yellow reproduces the more delicate shade induced by
the indoor life of the women. The hair, parted over
the forehead, falls in two masses alongside the cheeks.
The sleeveless dress is open in front, and the opening
extends in a point to between the two breasts: the stuff
exactly follows the lines of the body, and the skirt ends
a little above the ankle. The position of the breasts is
indicated by a special design; all the rest from the waist
to the feet is embroidered with ornaments in colour,
imitating the network of glass beads to be seen in the
museums.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> A necklace with two rows and bracelets
complete the costume. On the right, Knom, son of
Skhemka and Ati, serves as a pendant to his mother:
he is naked except for a necklace round the bottom of
his neck and a little square amulet that falls on his chest.
The grace and charm of the figures cannot be too much
admired. Although of small dimensions, the artist has
endowed them with the physiognomy and features suited
to their age with as much exactness as if he had been
dealing with a colossus. The firm flesh and rounded but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
muscular limbs of the woman in her prime, and the
chubby flesh and soft limbs of the child, are treated equally
happily. The mother’s face has a smiling charm, the son’s
a naïve and wondering grace: the Egyptian chisel did not
often work with so much intelligence and lightness.</p>

<div id="il_11" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="1896" height="2841" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>SKHEMKA WITH HIS WIFE AND SON.</p>

<p>Limestone. The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>The gesture with which each of the two small people
embraces the leg of the big one is not an artifice of
composition, a simple way of attaching the subordinate
elements of the group to the principal one. It is often
to be found in turning over the plates of Lepsius’s fine
work.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The inscriptions repeatedly state of the wife
that “she loved her husband,” and the artists reveal it
in action. Seated or standing by his side, she puts her
hand on his shoulder or her arm round his neck; crouching
or kneeling, she leans against him, her breast pressed
against his leg, her cheek leaning against his knee. And
it is not only in the privacy of the home that she treats
him with this affectionate abandon, but in public, before
the servants or the assembled vassals, while he is
inspecting his lands and reviewing his possessions.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>In the same way it is rare to find a personage without
his children, “who love him,” at his feet or by his side,
from the little, naked long-haired boy, like Knom, to
the grown-up sons and married daughters. To sum up,
the sculptor to whom we owe the Louvre monument
has carved in stone a scene of contemporary life. He
shows us Skhemka, Ati, and Knom grouped as they
were every day: and what is conventional in his work
is not the grouping of the three people, but the disproportion
in stature between the husband and wife, and
between the mother and son.</p>

<p>But here, again, he is only conforming to a prevailing
tradition of his art. In all the tombs of every period,
the master of the hypogeum is generally of the height
of the wall, while servants, friends, sons, and wives are
only of the height of one of the rows. The king, in the
warlike paintings of the temples, is of colossal size, while
the others, friends or enemies, beside him, look like a
crowd of pigmies. In that case we might imagine that
the difference in size showed only the difference of rank,
but the explanation does not suffice elsewhere. A slave
married for her beauty preserved something of the inferiority
of her former condition; a princess of the blood
royal, united in marriage to a private individual, did not
therefore renounce her royal rank. If inequality of stature
corresponded to inequality of rank, the sculptor would
have made the first smaller and the second bigger than
her husband. They did not, however, do that: slave or
princess, they gave the wife a stature sometimes equal
but more often lower than that of the husband.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the treatment does not show social distinction; the woman
was legally on the same level as the man. If the master
of the tomb is alone in his height, it is merely because
he alone is at home in the tomb, and it was desired to
show in him the one master, the personage who must be
protected against the dangers of the other world: so he was
designed of large size, as we underline a word in a sentence
in order to emphasize it.</p>

<p>In fact, the sculptor, in modelling his work, thought
of the necessities of the life beyond the tomb. Skhemka’s
wife living might be superior to Skhemka by fortune or
birth, and so take precedence of him; before the dead
Skhemka she was only a subordinate personage. Egyptian
theology supposed, it would seem, that the wife was as
indispensable to the man after as during life, and that is
why she is represented by his side on the walls of his
tomb; but, as she is only an accessory there, the sculptor
and the painter are free to treat her as they understand
the matter. If the husband demanded it, they gave both
the same stature, seated them on the same seat, made no
sort of difference between them. But if he expressed no
wish, they could either suppress her altogether or relegate
her to the background and give her the dimensions
of her son, as they did with Ati, in order that she may
lean against the seat on which her husband is
enthroned.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CROUCHING SCRIBE<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Vth</span> DYNASTY<br />

(<i>The Louvre</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">He</span> was found by Mariette in the tomb of Skhemka in
1851, during the soundings which preceded the discovery
of the Serapeum. He is now in the Louvre, in the centre
of the “Salle civile” of the Egyptian Gallery, surrounded
by show-case tables. His attitude, in conjunction with
the unfortunate place assigned him, makes him look like
a fellah dealer in antiquities seated in the midst of his
goods, patiently waiting for customers. The red paint,
which was perfect when he was brought to the Louvre,
has worn off in places with the coating on which it was
applied, and so the whity colour of the limestone shows
through here and there; the cross light from the two
windows falls on him in such a way as almost to efface
the modelling of the shoulders and chest: ordinary
visitors, for whom there is nothing to mark it, scarcely
look at it, and pass it by in complete indifference to the
fact that one of the masterpieces of Egyptian sculpture
is before them.</p>

<div id="il_12" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>CROUCHING SCRIBE.</p>

<p>The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>Does he represent the great lord in whose tomb
he was found? Other statues that entered the Louvre
with his bear the name of Skhemka and pass for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the faithful portrait of that personage.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> If, as their
careful composition leads us to believe, that claim is
justified, the Crouching Scribe was only one of the
numerous relatives or servants named in the inscriptions
of the chapel. The people of the Ancient
Empire had the custom of shutting up in the <i>Serdâb</i>,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
by the side of the statue of the dead person, those of
other individuals belonging to his family or his household.
They are mourners, both men and women crouching
down, one hand hanging or cast on the ground about
to pick up the dust in sign of mourning, the other held
in front of the face and plunged into the hair;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> women
who crush the grain on the stone; servants who thrust
their arm into an amphora, probably to coat it with
pitch before pouring in the beer or wine. Ours is a
scribe: his legs bent under him and placed flat on the
ground in one of those positions familiar to Orientals,
but almost impossible for Europeans, the bust upright
and well-balanced on the hips, the head raised; reed
in hand, and the sheet of papyrus spread over his
knees, he still waits, at an interval of 6,000 years,
for his master to resume the interrupted dictation.
The paintings in the contemporary tombs tell us a
hundred times rather than once what he is preparing to
write. In order to sustain himself in the other world,
the great Egyptian lord received on appointed days the
offerings due to him from the domains attached to his
tomb: one was to bring bread, one meat, others wine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
cakes, fruit. It was quite a big piece of bookkeeping,
identical with that usual in his lifetime. The scribes of
flesh and blood entered the real revenues as they came
in; the scribe of stone rendered the same service to the
master of stone whom he attended for ever.</p>

<p>We cannot say that our scribe was handsome in his
lifetime, but the truth and vigour of his portrait compensates
largely for what he lacks in beauty. The face
is almost square, and the strongly accentuated features
indicate a man in his prime; the large mouth with thin
lips is slightly raised at the corners and almost disappears
in the prominent muscles that frame it; the cheeks are
rather hard and bony; the ears are thick and heavy, and
stand out awkwardly from the head; and the low brow
is crowned with coarse, short hair. The eye is well
opened, and owes its special vivacity to an artifice of
the ancient sculptor. The stone in which it is set has
been cut away and the hollow filled with black and white
enamel; a bronze mounting marks the edges of the eyelids,
while a little silver nail<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> fastened under the crystal
at the bottom of the eyeball receives the light, and
reflecting it, simulates the pupil of a real eye. It is difficult
to imagine the striking effect that this combination
may produce in certain circumstances. When Mariette
cleared out the tomb of Râhotpou at Meîdoum, the first
ray of light which entered the tomb, that had been closed
for 6,000 years, fell on the forehead of two statues leaning
against the wall of the <i>Serdâb</i>, and made the eyes
sparkle so brilliantly that the fellahs threw down their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
tools and fled in terror. Recovered from their fear, they
wanted to destroy the statues, persuaded that they contained
an evil genius, and were only prevented from doing
so at the point of the pistol. More than one statue of
the Ancient Empire, intact at the moment of its discovery,
was mutilated for the same reason that nearly
proved fatal to those of Meîdoum. In the bad light in
which the Crouching Scribe is placed, the eyeball does
not shine with a sufficiently strong sparkle, but it really
does seem to have life in it and to follow the visitor with
its look.</p>

<p>The rest of the body is equally full of expression.
The flesh hangs a little, as is fitting with a man of a
certain age whose occupations prevent exercise. The arms
and back are good in detail; the lean bony hands have
fingers of a greater length than is usual; the rendering
of the knee is minute and exact in a way rarely found
elsewhere in Egyptian art. The whole body is, so to
speak, governed by the animation of the physiognomy,
and under the influence of the same feeling of expectation
that dominates it: the muscles of the arm, bust, and
shoulder are only partly at rest, ready at the first signal
to resume the task that has been begun. No work better
refutes the reproach of stiffness usually made in regard
to Egyptian art. Let us add that it is unique in
Europe, and that we must go to Boulaq for pieces fine
enough to sustain comparison without disadvantage.
But it is not enough to possess a masterpiece, it is still
more important to preserve it. In its present position
the Crouching Scribe runs more risks than formerly in
Egypt. The thousands of years spent buried beneath
the sand in a hypogeum on the tableland of Saqqarah
thoroughly dried up the limestone of which it is made.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Transported to our damp climate, and submitted to its
sudden changes of temperature, it is only too much
exposed to deterioration. It should not have been installed
without protection and naked, so to say, in the
centre of a room, between two large doors always open,
round about which there are perpetual draughts. The
curators at Turin have placed the fine limestone statue
of Amenôphis I possessed by the Museum in a tightly
closed glass cage, and to that protection is due the fact
that the Pharaoh has preserved its epidermis and colour
intact; the expense is not so great that the Louvre
would be impoverished by authorizing a similar proceeding.
The demotic inscriptions of the Serapeum are carefully
placed under glass, and the precaution is praiseworthy,
although it makes the study of them impossible;
it is then high time to take similar precautions with the
Scribe. The damp has already acted on it a little; the
red coating has been loosened and has fallen away in some
places. If the mechanical work of destruction is allowed
to proceed it will soon be in the same condition as the
three statues of Sapouî and his wife, and the Louvre will
have lost one of the finest pieces of sculpture Egypt has
given us.</p>

<p>In comparing it with the statues of Skhemka that
we have already described,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> we are led to ask why the
statue of a subordinate person should be so superior to
that of his master. The Egyptians knew nothing of
what we term art and the artist’s profession: their
sculptors were persons who cut stone with more or less
skill, but whose work, always subordinated to the plan
of a building, or to theological considerations, did not
possess the absolute value belonging to the least important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
statue of classical antiquity or of modern times. The
effigy of an individual was placed in his tomb, not
because it was beautiful, but because it represented him
and served as a support to his <i>double</i>. The question
of skill or artistic feeling was a subordinate one, and we
find twenty statues of the same person, some of which
are of finished workmanship and others coarse sketches:
whether a masterpiece or not, the stone body equally
served its purpose. Skhemka fell into the hands of a
merely conscientious workman, his scribe into those of a
highly skilled craftsman. I imagine that they cared little
enough if the sculptor brought more or less talent to his
task: so long as the resemblance was there, they asked
for nothing more.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NEW SCRIBE OF THE GIZEH MUSEUM<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor smaller">30</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> excavations undertaken by M. de Morgan in the
northern part of the necropolis of Saqqarah have recently
brought to light a mastaba in fine white stone, near the
tomb of Sabou, a little to the east of Mariette’s old house.
No architectural façade or chapels accessible to the living
were found, only a narrow corridor that plunges into the
masonry from north to south with 5° deviation to the
east. The walls had been prepared and made smooth to
receive the usual decoration, but when the mason had completed
his task, the sculptor, it would seem, had no time to
begin his. None of the sketches with the chisel or brush
customarily found in the unfinished tombs of all periods are
to be seen. Two large stelæ, or, if it is preferred, two
niches in the form of doors, had been prepared in the right-hand
wall, and a statue stood in front of each in the same
spot where the Egyptian workmen had placed them on
the day of the funeral. The first represents a man seated
squarely on a stool, wearing the loin-cloth, and on his
head a wig with rows of small curls one above the other.</p>

<div id="il_13" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;">
  <img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="1403" height="1770" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>THE NEW SCRIBE OF THE GIZEH MUSEUM.</p>

<p>Painted limestone.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>The bust and legs are bare; the fore-arms and hands
rest on the knees, the right hand closed with the thumb
sticking out, the left flat with the tips of the fingers
reaching beyond the hem of the loin-cloth. So far as
may be judged from a photograph, the general style is
somewhat weak; but the detail of the knee, the structure
of the leg and foot, are carefully rendered, the chest and
back stand out by the excellent modelling, the head,
weighted as it is by the coiffure, is attached to the
shoulder with an easy and not ungraceful vivacity. The
face is not in good relief, and has a sheepish expression,
but the mouth is smiling, and the eyes of quartz and
crystal have an extraordinarily gentle expression. Taken
altogether it is a very good piece of Egyptian portraiture,
and would be a valuable addition to any museum.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The new scribe was crouching in front of the second
stele.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> He measures in height almost the same as his
colleague in the Louvre, and sufficiently resembles him
to permit both being described in almost similar terms.
The legs are bent under and are flat on the ground, the
bust upright and well balanced on the hips, the head
raised, the hand armed with the reed, and in its place
on the open papyrus sheet; they are both waiting at
an interval of 6,000 years for the master to resume
the interrupted dictation.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The professional gesture and
attitude are reproduced with a truth that leaves nothing
to be desired: it is not only a scribe whom we have
before us, it is the scribe as the Egyptians knew him
from the beginning of their history. The skill with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the sculptors have brought out and co-ordinated the
general features belonging to each class of society is
largely responsible for the impression of monotony produced
by their works on modern spectators. That
impression is lessened and nearly effaced, if we look a
little more closely and see how carefully the sculptors
have noted and reproduced the details of form and
bearing that make up the physiognomy proper to each of
the individuals who live in the same social surroundings
or practise the same profession. Our two scribes do not
cross their legs in identical fashion; he of the Louvre
puts the right leg in front, he of Gizeh the left. There
is no fixed choice, and children at first tuck their legs
under without thought of preference for one or the other;
soon they acquire a habit which makes them keep to the
position once adopted, and in the East to-day you find
people who put either the left or right leg in front, and
just a few who put either one or the other indifferently.
The Louvre scribe flattens out the hand that holds the
reed, the man of Gizeh sinks down, and his back is
slightly bent. This shows the habit of the individual, and
is not a question of age, for a glance at the two statues
shows that the Gizeh scribe is younger than his colleague
of the Louvre: he is not out of the thirties, while the
other is certainly over forty.</p>

<p>Indeed, the age of the two men is an important point
of which we must not lose sight, if we desire to judge
soberly the real value of the two works. I have heard
archæologists, when comparing them, regret that the
scribe of Gizeh does not show the same abundance of
carefully studied anatomical detail as the scribe of the
Louvre; that therein lies the real inferiority of the first,
whether it was that the sculptor was less conversant with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the anatomy of the human body than with that of the face,
or that time had pressed, and he had contented himself with
giving his subject the conventional body that for the most
part sufficed in funerary statues. The care, as I have
pointed out, with which the small details of the attitude
are expressed shows that the reproach is undeserved, and
that the artist has worked to give a portrait complete
from top to toe, and not only to reproduce a head on a
conventional body. The roundness of the form preserves
the appearance of the original, and shows, realistically,
the age the subject was at the time of his death, or
at least at the period of life at which his relatives desired
to have a portrait of him. In the best facsimile something
of the delicacy of the monument itself must be
lost, and in spite of the great care taken in engraving it,
its original aspect is not entirely preserved. I think,
however, that in looking closely at it there can still be
seen in many places the artistic, supple workmanship by
which the chisel expressed the delicacy and vigour of the
model. The most vigorous fellah of our day, when young
and in good health, has apparently slender muscles that
do not stand out: like those of the porters of Boulaq,
one of whom without aid moved a stone statue of nearly
the same height as himself, and yet had hands and
calves like those of a woman, that looked of slight
strength and incapable of continuous effort. The knotty
and twisted excrescences to be seen on the arms, back,
or chest of our athletes were rarely found in Egyptians
of ancient race, at least in youth. The ancient sculptor
rightly noted that physiological trait of his people. He
had a young man before him: so he evolved from the
limestone a young Egyptian body in which the play of
the muscles is hidden beneath the skin, and is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
betrayed by a number of touches manipulated with
knowledge and discretion. If, like his colleague who
sculptured the Louvre scribe, he had had to portray a
person of ripe age, he would not have exerted himself to
bring out the flabbiness of the flesh and the heaviness
of its folds, to execute all the pleasant work of the chisel
which so well reproduces the depredations of age in a rich
sedentary man of fifty. In short, he worked differently
because he had a different subject.</p>

<p>There is no sort of inscription on either statue to
inform us of the name and characteristics of its original,
who must have been a person of some importance: a
large tomb invariably meant a considerable fortune, or a
high post in the administrative hierarchy which compensated
for mediocrity of fortune. It might also be that
Pharaoh, desiring to reward services rendered him by
some one in his <i>entourage</i>, granted him a statue, a stele,
an entire tomb built by the royal architects at the
expense of the Treasury.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> It is certain that our anonymous
scribe held high rank in his lifetime, but to what
Dynasty did he belong? He so closely resembles the
scribe of the Louvre that he was evidently his contemporary:
he must then have lived at the end of the Vth
Dynasty, and we reach a similar result if we compare him
with the other statues preserved at Gizeh. It is of the
style of the statues of Ti and of Rânofir, especially of
the last two. One of them, which formerly was No. 975
in the Boulaq Museum, is full of dignified feeling.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
Rânofir is standing, his two arms pressed against his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
body, one leg in advance, in the attitude of a prince who
is looking at his vassals march past him. Whoever has
seen him cannot fail to observe how much he resembles
our new scribe. Firstly, the head-dress is the same; they
both have the head framed, so to speak, in a bell-mouthed
wig. The hairs or fibres of which it is made were
gummed, as is the case to-day with the hair of certain
African tribes. The hair is carefully smoothed on the
forehead and the top of the head, and being parted on
the cranium, hangs down and forms a kind of dark case
round the face which accentuates the ruddy tint of the
flesh. The modelling of the torso, the muscling of the
arms, are treated in the same way in both statues, and
the dignified expression which characterizes the physiognomy
of Rânofir relieves the somewhat commonplace
features of the new scribe. Those are all facts that are
not to be noted in other portraits of our personages.
The seated statue that I first described possesses the
general aspect of the individual, and undoubtedly represents
him; but the technique and feeling differ, since it
is necessarily that of a different sculptor. It is the same
with Rânofir. The statue of him numbered 1049 in the
Boulaq Museum lacks the high dignity we admire in
No. 975. It is so heavy, so expressionless, that it almost
seems to be another Egyptian. The difference in the
workmanship proves that two artists were commissioned
to execute statues of the same man. The identity of
workmanship, on the other hand, compels us to recognize
the same hand in the statue No. 975 of Rânofir and in
that of our new scribe: the two works proceeded almost
at the same time from one studio.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to find out if, among the statues
in the museums, there are others that may be related to these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
and have a common origin. I do not so far know any, but
I ought to add to what I have said the indication of a
special sign by which they can be distinguished. The
Egyptians were accustomed to paint their statues and bas-reliefs,
and the colours in which
they clothed them were more
varied, and more subject to
change, than is generally recognized.
We are used to see only
a red-brown tone for the flesh,
and they certainly employed it
very often; they did not, however,
employ that tone only,
and men’s faces are occasionally
coloured in a very different way.
The colouring of statue No. 975
and of the new scribe differs
from the usual manner. That of
statue No. 975 has grown paler
since Rânofir left his tomb and
became exposed to the light, but
that of the Gizeh scribe is still
fresh, and resembles as faithfully
as possible the yellow complexion
bordering on red of the modern
fellah. The greater number of
archæologists who occupy themselves
with Egyptian art neglect
facts of this kind. During my stay
in Egypt I have endeavoured to bring them out, and it is
in co-ordinating them systematically that I have been able
to verify the existence, either at Memphis itself or in the
ancient village of Saqqarah, of two principal studios of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
sculptors and painters to which customers of the later periods
of the Vth Dynasty entrusted the task of decorating the
tombs and carving the funerary statues.</p>

<p>Each had its special style, its traditions, its models, from
which it did not willingly depart. Commissions were
divided between them in unequal proportions, according to
whether it was a question of isolated statues or of bas-reliefs.
I do not remember observing sensible differences of
style in the pictures that cover the walls of the same
mastaba: for that kind of work application was made to
one or the other studio, and it alone undertook the commission.
For the statues, on the contrary, recourse was
had to both at the same time: the task, thus divided, was
more quickly accomplished, and there was more chance that
it would be finished by the day of the funeral. I do not
mean to state that there were then only the two studios of
which I speak: I think I have found traces of several others,
but they perhaps enjoyed less vogue, or the chances of
excavation have not so far been favourable to them.</p>

<p>To sum up, we may say, without the risk of being taxed
with exaggeration, that the art of the Ancient Empire
counts another masterpiece. It was a gift of happy chance
to M. de Morgan in his first serious excavations as earnest
of good fortune: it is of good augury for the future, and, as
he is not a man to let a chance slip once he holds it, and
since he has the material means and the money required
for methodical exploration, we may hope for further finds
without long delay.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE KNEELING SCRIBE<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Vth</span> DYNASTY<br />

(<i>Boulaq Museum</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> he had not been dead for 6,000 years, I should swear that
I met him six months ago in a little town of Upper Egypt.
It was the same commonplace round face, the same
flattened nose, the same full mouth, slightly contracted on
the left by a foolish smile, the same banal expressionless
physiognomy: the costume alone was different and
prevented the illusion from being complete. The loin-cloth
is no longer in fashion, and neither is the large wig; except
the fellahs when at work, no one now goes about with bare
legs and torso. Some follow fairly closely the custom of
Cairo, and wear the too small tarbouche, the stiff stambouline,
the European starched shirt, but without a cravat,
black or crude blue trousers, shoes with cloth gaiters.
Others keep to the turban, long gown, wide trousers, and
red or yellow morocco leather babouches. But if his clothes
have changed since the Vth Dynasty, his deportment has
remained perceivably identical. The modern secretary,
after delivering his papers to his master, crosses his hands
over his chest or his stomach in the fashion of the ancient
scribe; he no longer kneels while waiting, but assumes the
humblest attitude imaginable, and if his costume did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
hide it, we should recognize the suppleness that characterizes
the Boulaq statue in the movement of his shoulders and
spine. His chief finishes reading the papers, affixes his seal
to this one or that, writes a few lines across another, and
throws the sheets on the ground: the secretary picks
them up, and returns to his office without offence at the
cavalier manner in which his work is given back to him.
Indeed, is it to be expected that a moudir, a man receiving
a large salary, would take the trouble to stretch out his arm
to meet the hand of a mere ill-paid employee? In fact,
he treats his subordinates as his superiors treat him; his
subordinates, in their turn, act in a similar way towards
theirs, and so things go on right down the ladder, and no
one dreams of objecting.</p>

<p>Our scribe was one of those to whom the papers were
thrown more often than to others. He occupied a
somewhat low place in the hierarchy, and no bond attached
him to the great families of his period. If he is kneeling,
it is that the sculptor has represented him in one of his
ordinary attitudes during the hours of work; he has
also drawn his portrait with the fidelity and jovial good
humour adopted by artists in portraying scenes of everyday
life. The man has just brought a roll of papyrus or a
tray laden with papers; kneeling in the approved manner,
the bust well-balanced on the hips, the hands crossed, the
back bowed, the head slightly bent, he waits until his master
has finished reading. Does he think? Scribes felt some
secret apprehension when appearing before their masters.
The rod played a large part in the discipline of the offices.
An error in the addition of an account, a word omitted
in copying a letter, an instruction misunderstood, an order
awkwardly executed, and the blows fell. Few employees
escaped flogging. If they did not deserve it, it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
inflicted on principle: “That young fellow requires a beating.
He obeys when he is flogged!”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The sculptor has
admirably transferred to the stone the expression of resigned
uncertainty and sheepish gentleness with which the routine
of an entire life spent in service had endowed the model.
The mouth is smiling, for such is the demand of etiquette,
but there is no joy in the smile. The nose and cheeks
grimace in unison with the mouth. The two big enamel
eyes, surrounded with bronze, have the fixed expression
of a man who is vaguely waiting, without looking attentively
at anything or concentrating his thought on a
definite object. The face lacks intelligence and vivacity.
After all, the profession did not exact great alertness of
mind. The formulas of administration were simple and
of little variety, the arithmetic was not complicated; it
was possible to get on easily with memory and industry,
and so, without much trouble, to earn sufficient to purchase
a good funerary statue.</p>

<p>Our statue was found at Saqqarah<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> in a tomb of
somewhat mediocre appearance. Neither the name nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
filiation of the man informs us under what king or Dynasty
he vegetated; but in comparing him with the statue of
Rânofir<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> we are able to assign him his place in the series.
First, both our scribe and Rânofir wear a wig of a form
somewhat rare at that period; the hair, parted from the
centre of the brow, is drawn back in a mass behind the
ears and hangs down straight round the neck. Our scribe,
instead of the red complexion usually attributed to men’s
faces, is painted light yellow, very like those of women.
Rânofir shows the same peculiarity, an unusual one under
the Ancient Empire. I do not think it could have been
mere caprice on the part of the artist. A scribe, forced
to live always in his office as women do in their homes,
would have a less sunburnt skin than his colleagues who
worked in the open air: the yellow colour of the limestone
would thus be a sort of professional sign, and would
correspond with a lighter complexion in the original. The
titles of Rânofir prove that he lived under the last reigns of
the Vth Dynasty,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and in placing the kneeling scribe at the
same period, we are sure of not being much in error. I
have preferred to base my opinions on purely archæological
grounds, but I think an examination of the style of the
two statues would carry the connection still farther: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
way in which the neck is attached to the shoulders, and
particularly the way in which the hands are treated, is
almost identical in the two cases. I do not know if I
am mistaken, but I have almost persuaded myself that
the statue of Rânofir and that of the kneeling scribe come
from the same studio, and are perhaps the fruit of the
same chisel. I do not despair of finding other monuments
of a similar origin, and of reconstituting in part the work
of one of the masters of which the tombs of Memphis
have preserved the various productions, but without
preserving their names.</p>

<p>The execution is very careful: unfortunately the limestone
in which the scribe is cut was too soft, and it is
worn away in places. The knees have suffered most, and
it is a great pity, for we can see by what is left of them
how careful the artist has been with the modelling. The
arms are not divided from the bust, the hands are heavy,
the feet long, but the play of the muscles of the chest
and neck is well noted. In short, it is an estimable work
of a conscientious sculptor who thoroughly understood
his vocation.</p>

<span class="subhead">PEHOURNOWRI<br />

<span class="subhead">STATUETTE IN PAINTED LIMESTONE FOUND AT MEMPHIS<br />

(<i>The Louvre</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Mariette</span> found the statuette by chance when searching
the Serapeum. It had formerly been taken from the pit
in which it was shut up and thrown amid the rubbish of
the great sphinx avenue that leads to the tomb of Apis.
The individual was named Pehournowri; he was cousin
royal, and fulfilled functions that I do not know how
to define. Nothing in the inscription helps us to conjecture
with what king he claimed relationship, but its
style proves that he lived under the Vth Dynasty. That
he was of mature age is indicated by the plenitude of
form, by the fine proportions and the benevolent and
benign aspect. A short wig, a necklace, a loin-cloth
scarcely reaching the knees, completes his costume. His
statue is not one in front of which we naturally pause when
walking through a museum. I do not think that during
the thirty years it has been in the Louvre it has attracted
the attention of any one except experts in Egyptology.
Not that it lacks merit: the modelling is exact, the
execution skillful and delicate, the expression frank and
successful, but the pose differs very slightly from that
which hundreds of other artists have given to hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of other statues. The careless visitor who passes from
one seated man to a second, and then to many others,
does not think of looking for the details of execution
that distinguish them. He thinks that when he has seen
one or two he has seen all, and departs with the idea
that the chief attribute of Egyptian art is monotony.</p>

<p>Egyptian sculptors did not greatly vary the pose of
their sitters. Sometimes they represented them standing
and walking, one leg in advance of the other, sometimes
standing, but motionless, with the feet together, sometimes
sitting on a seat or a stone pedestal, sometimes
kneeling, more often crouching, the chin against the knees
like the fellahs of to-day, or the legs flat on the ground
like the scribe of the Louvre.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The details of arrangement
and costume may be modified <i>ad infinitum</i>, but
the attitude is nearly always regulated by the six types
I have enumerated. Some modern critics attribute this fact
to the inexperience of the sculptors, others to the inflexibility
of certain hieratical rules. But having seen not
only the few incomplete pieces to be found in Europe, but
also the monuments still existing in Egypt, I cannot
admit those reasons. Everywhere in the bas-reliefs of the
temples and tombs a multiplicity of gestures or attitudes
are to be seen which show to what point the artists
could, when they pleased, diversify the human figure:
the peasant bends over the hoe, the joiner leans over his
bench, the scribe stoops over his paper, the dancers,
girls and men, twist and balance their bodies, the soldiers
brandish their lances or march in time, as naturally as
possible. And the sculptors even reproduced positions
in their statues very different from those we are accustomed
to see at the Louvre: the kneeling woman who is grinding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
her corn, the baker who is kneading the dough, the
slave who coats the amphora with pitch before pouring
in the wine, the crouching mourner of Boulaq,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> are all composed
and modelled with a lightness of action and a
perfection of expression that leaves no doubt as to the skill
of the artist. It is true that hieratical rules existed, and
no one will dispute that fact, but they were reserved for
matters of religion and for those alone. They exacted,
for instance, that Amon must always, in every case,
have the attributes, costume, and attitude proper to the
god, but they in no wise ordered that all men were to
be confined to one of the five attitudes I have just
described. The freedom of composition to which the
large historical pictures of the temples or the domestic
scenes of the tombs testify, does not agree with what we
are told concerning the inflexibility of the hieratical rules.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>PEHOURNOWRI.</p>

<p>The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>I shall not now touch on the statues of kings or
divinities: I shall have an opportunity later of treating
them at leisure. Those of private individuals represent
for the most part persons of rank, great nobles, people of
the court, officers, magistrates, priests, employees of birth
or fortune; they come from nearly all the cemeteries,
and are portraits of the man for whom the tomb was
hollowed out or of people of his house. The master
stands in an attitude of command, or sits like Pehournowri,
and he could only have one or the other of those
attitudes. The tomb is, in fact, his private house, where
he rests from the fatigues of life, as he used to do in
his terrestrial home. A soldier when at home does not
carry his arms, a magistrate does not wear his robe:
soldier or magistrate, the insignia of the profession are
laid aside when he returns home. Thus the master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
the tomb always wears his civil costume, and leaves the
marks of his profession at the door.</p>

<p>Then, also, the accessible part of his dwelling has a
special destination which regulates the pose of the statues:
it is, in fact, his reception-room, where on certain days the
family assembled to present the offerings to him, in more
prosaic words, to dine with him. Whether his statue was
visible in one of the open chambers or invisible in the
<i>Serdâb</i>,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> it was his substitute. It is sufficient to look at the
neighbouring bas-reliefs to discover what were the official
attitudes of the dead man in the tomb. He was present
at the preliminaries of the sacrifice, the sowing and
the harvest, the rearing of the cattle, fishing, hunting, the
execution of crafts, and he saw all the works carried
out for the <i>eternal dwelling</i>: he was then standing, one
foot in advance, head erect, hands hanging down, or
armed with the staff of command. Elsewhere, one after
the other, the different courses of the meal are served
him, cakes, wines, canonical meats, fruits which he needs
in the world of the dead: then he is seated in an armchair
alone or with his wife. The sculptor employed for
his statues the two positions he has in the paintings:
standing, he receives the homage of his vassals; seated,
he takes part in the meal. And in the same way the
statues which embody the members of the family and of
the household have likewise the attitude suited to their
rank and occupation. The wife is sometimes standing,
sometimes sitting on the same seat as her husband, or on a
separate one; sometimes, as in life, crouching at his feet.
The son wears the costume of childhood, if the statue was
carved while he was still a child, or the costume and
attitude of his office if he was an adult. The acting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
scribe crouches, the roll spread on his knees, as if he was
writing from dictation or reading from an account-book.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
The slave grinds the corn, the bakers knead the dough, the
cellarers pitch their amphoras, the mourners lament and
tear their hair as it was their duty to do in the world
above; each individual is occupied according to his
condition. The social hierarchy followed the Egyptian
after death, and it regulated the pose of the statue after,
as it had regulated that of the model before, death. Up
to a certain point it is the same to-day, and he who carves
the statue of a printer is careful not to attribute to him
the action and costume of a miner or a sailor. These
statues, shut up in the tomb, formed a sort of tableau in
which each person held for ever the pose characteristic of
his rank or his profession. The artist was free to vary
the detail and regulate the accessories according to his
fancy, but he could not change the general disposition
without injuring the utility of his work.</p>

<p>At bottom, it is with the statues of Ancient Egypt as
with the pictures of saints of the Italian schools. The
painters had to treat their subject on lines from which
they could not depart without falsifying or disfiguring it.
Bring sixty or eighty St. Sebastians together in a room:
how many of those who saw them would escape the
boredom that infallibly results from constant repetition?
When the tenth St. Sebastian was reached only a few professional
artists would not have already gone away. I am
supposing, too, that only choice pictures had been collected
in which the qualities of a master are easily
recognized. If, on the contrary, there had been collected
at random all the available St. Sebastians without first
eliminating the bad pictures, the finest St. Sebastians in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
the world, lost in the crowd, would be likely to attract
no more attention from the public than the Crouching
Scribe or the other masterpieces of Egyptian sculpture
in the Louvre. The hypothesis appears absurd, because
no one will easily admit that any one could have the idea
of making such a collection. I agree so far as modern
or ancient works, the value of which is known, are concerned;
but Egyptian Museums have so far always been
classified as depôts of archæological objects, not as art
galleries. Each statue is a scribe, a god, a king; it is the
scribe Hor of the XIXth Dynasty, or the scribe Skhemka
of the Vth, or the king Sovkhotpou, wearing the head-dress
of the pschent, and that is all. The trumpery
scribes and the scribes that emanate from the hands of
a master are confused under the same rubric, and no
mark is placed to distinguish the good from the bad.
Pehournowri is a scribe, Ramke a second scribe, Rahotpou
a third scribe, just as the St. Sebastian of such or such
a great Italian master and the St. Sebastians of the Epinal
pictures are two St. Sebastians: the public which is not
warned, and which has no more interest in one scribe
than in another, passes on without looking.</p>

<p>The impression of monotony is produced by the perpetual
repetition of the same types and by the method
of classification adopted in the museums. If it was decided
to do for Egypt what has been done for Greece and Rome,
to separate the productions of art and the objects of
archæology, people’s opinion would be promptly modified.
The impression of monotony would not wholly disappear,
because the number of types studied by the Egyptian
sculptors was not sufficiently numerous: it would be
lessened and would no longer blind the crowd to the real
beauty and perfection that reside in Egyptian sculpture.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DWARF KHNOUMHOTPOU<br />

<span class="subhead">(<span class="smcap">Vth</span> OR <span class="smcap">VIth</span> DYNASTY)<br />

(<i>Boulaq Museum</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> charming person who left us this statue is known,
since the Exhibition of 1878, by the name of the Superintendent
of the Cooks; his title in the inscription on the
pedestal indicates a keeper of the wardrobe. In his lifetime
he doubtless enjoyed some notoriety, since he had one of
the fine tombs of Saqqarah for himself alone, but we know
nothing of his history. His name was Khnoumhotpou, a
name later made illustrious by a prince of Minieh under
the XIIth Dynasty: his place of burial proves that he
was born at the end of the Vth or beginning of the
VIth Dynasty.</p>

<p>He was a dwarf, and a very small dwarf. The statue
is scarcely a foot in height, and the dimensions of the
head show that it was probably half the natural size. It
reproduces the characteristics proper to dwarfs without
exaggerating them. The head, of a suitable size, is long-shaped
and flanked by two large ears. The expression
of the face is heavy and stupid, the eyes narrow and
raised at the temples, and the mouth wide and ill-formed.
The chest is strong and well developed, but the artist
has employed his ingenuity in vain in order to dissimulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the hind-quarters by covering them with a vast white
petticoat; notwithstanding, we feel that the torso is
not in proportion to the arms and legs. The stomach
forms a round projection, and the hips recede in order
to counterbalance the stomach. The thighs only exist in
a rudimentary state, and the whole individual, mounted as
he is on little deformed feet, seems about to fall face
downwards on the ground. The flesh was painted red,
the hair black, but the colour has peeled off or been
effaced in places. The two legs were broken formerly at
the ankle, then stuck on again when the statue was
transported to the Museum. It is very possible that the
accident happened during the execution of the statue, for
the limestone used by the Egyptians is so fragile that the
sculptor did not venture to detach the arms from the
body: too hard a blow of the mallet while freeing the legs
may have caused the unfortunate fracture that spoils the
bottom of the monument.</p>

<p>Khnoumhotpou is, so far, the only dwarf that has come
to light who is a nobleman. Similar dwarfs were not
lacking in Egypt, but they nearly all belonged to the
class of jugglers and buffoons. The Pharaohs and the
princes of their court bestowed the same affection on these
deformed creatures as did Christian or Mussulman kings
in mediæval times; their household would not have been
complete without two or three of them of an aspect more
or less grotesque. Ti possessed one that figures by her
in her tomb: the poor wretch holds in his right hand a
kind of large wooden sceptre terminated by a model of
a human hand, and leads a greyhound almost as tall as
himself in a leash. Elsewhere dwarfs are represented
crouching on a stool at the feet of their masters, by the
side of the favourite monkey or dog. We know from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the pictures of Beni-Hassan that two of them belonged to
the prince of Minieh’s suite; one, despite his small size,
does not lack elegance, but the other enjoys with the
exiguity of his stature the pleasure of being club-footed.
The Egyptian heaven did not escape the prevailing mania
any more than the court of the Pharaohs, and it included
several dwarfs, of whom two at least had an important
rôle: Bîsa, who presided over arms and the toilet, and the
Phtah, who for a long while has, without reason, been
called embryonic Phtah.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Perhaps Knoumhotpou joined
to his functions of keeper of the wardrobe the office of
court buffoon; perhaps he was of noble birth, and preserved
by his origin from the disagreeables to which his brethren
of low extraction were exposed.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE DWARF KHNOUMHOTPOU.</p>

<p>Cairo Museum.</p></div></div>

<p>But we have no need to know what he was: merely
in leaving us his portrait, he has rendered signal service
to science. Let us recall the part played by the statues
of the tombs in the theological conceptions of the
Egyptians: they were the indispensable support of the
<i>double</i>, the body without which the soul of the dead
person could not exist in the other world. It might be
thought that in passing from life in this world to that
beyond the tomb, the people to whom beauty had been
chary might not have been sorry to assume a new
appearance; if we are to be re-born, it is better to be
re-born less ugly. The care that poor Khnoumhotpou
has taken to reach us deformed shows that the old
Egyptians did not hold our views on the subject: they
desired to remain always as nature created them at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
moment of conception. It was not absence of coquetry
on their part, but necessity: their idea of the soul
compelled them so to act. From the moment that their
personality was indissolubly bound up with the existence
of the body, the first condition imposed on them for
remaining identical with themselves after death, as before,
was to preserve their earthly form intact. In order that
the Khnoumhotpou who dwelt in the hypogeum of
Saqqarah might not be a different being from the
Khnoumhotpou who walked through the streets of
Memphis, it was necessary that his disincarnated <i>double</i>
should find there the support of a statue of a dwarf. Give
him the fine proportions of Ti or Rânofir, the proud
bearing and haughty mien of the Cheîkh-el-Beled, even the
more common type of the Crouching Scribe, he would
not have known what to do. His substance, poured, so
to speak, into the exiguous and deformed mould of the
dwarf, could never have adapted itself to the new mould
into which the artist would have tried to cast it.
Khnoumhotpou beautified would no longer have been
Khnoumhotpou; his tomb, without the statue of a dwarf,
would only have sheltered a double and a support strangers
to each other.</p>

<p>It was then the likeness, and the absolute likeness,
that the artist had to seek to reproduce, and the seriousness
and scrupulousness with which he rendered the deformity
of his model is thus explained. The Egyptians were
scoffers by nature, and liked to mingle the comic with
the serious, not only in literature but in the arts. To take
only one example: the painter who, at Thebes, pictured
the interment of Nofrihotpou, has drawn, by the side of
the large boats laden with mourners and all the apparatus
of grief, the contortions of two sailors whose shallop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
was brutally struck by the oars of the funerary barque.
If the sculptor who chiselled Khnoumhotpou had been
free to follow his natural inclination, he would probably
have exaggerated certain features and given the unfortunate
creature a slightly absurd physiognomy. His
religious conscience would not permit him to risk anything
of the kind: a statue uglier than nature would have
been as inconvenient to the soul of the original as a statue
more beautiful than nature. A body of stone identical
at all points with the body of flesh was what the
Egyptian demanded, and that is exactly what the sculptor
fashioned for the little Khnoumhotpou. We see here
that what we call the question of art is subsidiary: a
stone-cutter who understood his business sufficed for all
that was required.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be concluded from what precedes
that I regard the portrait of Khnoumhotpou as the work
of a mere artisan. It has been too often repeated that
statuary in Egypt was a mechanical craft; sculptors were
taught to fashion arms, legs, heads, and torsos, and to
join them, according to the formula, in imitation of two
or three models always the same. That opinion, repeated
by the Greeks, is fairly difficult to uphold in the presence
of the statue of Knoumhotpou; it might be possible to
set up patterns for bodies of ordinary formation, but all
varieties of deformed bodies could not possibly be foreseen.
The unknown master whose work we have at Boulaq
proceeded in exactly the same manner as a modern
sculptor, the necessities of whose work confronted him
with a deformed model: he produced a work of art, not
the task of a mechanic.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A large</span> pool among the ruins, and at the southern end
two batteries of <i>chadoufs</i>, one on top of the other, working
to exhaust the water continually renewed by the infiltrations.
On the banks are blocks and muddy statues,
round which half-naked workmen are busily occupied,
beams, levers, coils of rope, and the beginnings of a
Decauville line; remains of storied walls dominate the
workshops, and the modern village of Karnak stands out
clearly on the horizon beyond their irregular tops.</p>

<p>When the first Ptolemies decided at the beginning of
the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to restore the Theban temple of
Amon, they found it encumbered with <i>ex-votos</i>. Everywhere,
in the halls, the corridors, the court-yards, there
were stelæ, stone statues, little wooden or bronze figures,
sacred or royal insignia, heaped up one on the other, and
in such quantities that there was no space for new ones.
It was a legacy of extinct Dynasties or of noble families
who had died out, to whom the Pharaohs had granted the
privilege of consecrating their image in the house of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
god, and to sell or destroy any of them would have
been to commit sacrilege.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> They were dealt with
according to the custom of the contemporary peoples: a
vast pit was dug between the seventh pylon and the
hypostyle hall, and then they were buried pell-mell in
holy ground. Twenty centuries later, in 1883, hastily
made soundings revealed the richness of the site to me,
but, lacking money, I could not venture to undertake
anything. It was not until 1901, when the regular progress
of clearing away brought the workmen to the spot, that
I advised M. Legrain to dig more deeply than usual, so
that nothing which was hidden beneath the earth might
escape observation. The excavations yielded just what I
had foreseen, royal colossi in granite, limestone, sandstone
which were restored to their ancient places along the
pylon; a little below came fragments of a fine limestone
building of Amenôthes I that Thoutmôsis III had used
for banking up when he enlarged the temple; and at the
very bottom, at a depth of over six, twelve, fourteen yards,
what none of us had thought of, an intact <i>favissa</i> in which
hundreds of statues and small objects awaited in the mud
the hour of their deliverance.</p>

<p>For four years M. Legrain has been exploring the spot
foot by foot, and I think he has succeeded in entirely
emptying it. We must now draw up the inventory of
the treasures it has bestowed on us. The greatest benefit
conferred by them is assuredly on political history. All
epochs are not represented in equal abundance—the first
Theban Empire is, so to speak, merely mentioned, and the
two great Dynasties of the second are represented only by
about a hundred pieces—but from the fall of the Ramessides
to the Persian conquest the series of the high priests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
of Amon reappears almost complete, with their wives,
sons, brothers, the children or latest descendants of their
brothers, and from the day when the male line failed,
the princesses who inherited its rights, with the noble
persons who wielded the power in their name. However,
the large find all at once of statues and inscriptions serves not
only to give information about the revolution that transformed
the military kingdom of Thebes into a theocracy,
but also furnishes documents for the study of the progress
of art during the twenty centuries and more that the
revolution took. The artistic merit of the objects is very
unequal, and many of them are only interesting to the
archæologist; some, however, stand out distinguished
above the mass, and take their rank worthily beside
the best known productions of Egyptian art. As they
come from the same temple, and have been erected by
different members of the same families, it is natural
to see in them the work of one school, established at
Thebes in far-off antiquity. Indeed, a unity of character
common to all is easily discerned, which, perpetuating
itself without notable change from generation to generation,
fixes undeniable affinities of conception and technique.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Setting aside a few stelæ in which the arrangement
is bad and the composition coarse,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> the most ancient
monuments we possess of that school are those discovered
by Carter and Naville between 1900 and 1906 in the tomb
of Montouhotpou V at Deîr-el-Baharî. The bas-reliefs of
the chapel belonging to the pyramid are as correct in design<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
and as firm in touch as the fine Memphian bas-reliefs
of the Vth or VIth Dynasty; but the relief is more
accentuated, the outline bolder and freer, the man more
thick-set, and more firmly placed on the ground, the
woman of a more slender figure, with larger hips and a
more ample bosom. The statue of the king which
is in the Cairo Museum<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> was cut in the sandstone with
a bold, firm chisel. The feet and knees are thick, the
hands massive, the bust indicated in summary fashion,
the face boldly modelled. The colour is harsh, the flesh
black, the costume white, the cap red, according to the
ritual of the ceremonies for which it was destined; the
whole has an aspect of barbarism, but a premeditated
barbarism, having regard to the religious effect to be
produced. If a Memphian sculptor had treated a
similar subject, he would not have failed to harmonize
the lines and soften the colour: unconsciously he would
have fused its type with the softer type of human
physiognomy that prevailed in his school, at the risk
of enfeebling its energy. The Theban sculptor, on the
contrary, exerted himself above all to reproduce the truth
as it revealed itself to him, and that preoccupation is
dominant to the end with all of his school. They sought
the likeness with the intention of exaggerating rather than
of softening the individual features of the subject, and
in order to attain it, did not shrink from roughness of
execution nor violence of colour: they often fell into
barbarism, but scarcely ever into banality.</p>

<p>When, under the XIIth Dynasty, Thebes became one
of the capitals of Egypt, its kings sometimes employed
local artists, sometimes called in sculptors imbued with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the Memphian tradition from Heracleopolis or the Fayoum.
Chance has preserved for us two colossal heads, one of
Sanouosrît I (Ousirtasen),<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> discovered by Mariette in the
ruins of Abydos, the other of Sanouosrît III, extracted
by M. Legrain from the pit at Karnak. The handicraft
is excellent in both cases, and seldom has this unpromising
stone been worked with greater skill, but the
inspiration of the whole is different. Here are two
persons of the same race, and the general resemblance
is sufficient to set aside any doubt: for if it were not
there, we should be tempted to see in each a sovereign
of a different Dynasty. The first belongs to a school
inspired by the Memphian tradition: the sculptor has
idealized or, if preferred, symbolized his model, and has
given it the short full oval, the smiling good-humoured
face that the school adopted for official statues of the
Pharaohs. The second, on the other hand, copied the
features without softening a single one; the face is long
and thin, the brow narrow, the cheek-bones prominent,
the jaw bony and heavy. He has hollowed the cheeks,
surrounded the nose with two deep furrows, tightened the
lower lip and projected it into a contemptuous pout; he
has realized a strong work, whereas the other, penetrated
by opposite principles, has only evolved from the stone
an agreeable composition, but one lacking individuality.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="clear">The contrast between the two methods is less striking
in the bas-reliefs than in the statues. Among the
fragments used by Thoutmôsis III for filling up is
a square pillar emanating from a limestone building of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Sanouosrît I. The Pharaoh is seen on one of the sides
accompanied by Phtah. They are there, the sovereign
and the god, face to face, breathing each other’s breath,
according to the etiquette of greeting between persons
equal in rank. The style greatly resembles that of the
Memphian school, but when examined more closely,
peculiarities of the Theban school are to be distinguished.
The contours are firmly fixed, the relief is less flat, and
consequently the shadows less thin, and thus the outline of
the figures stands out more strongly against the background
than in the pictures of Gizeh or Saqqarah:
a Memphian would perhaps have displayed more elegance,
but would have remained true to convention. The scenes
engraved on the other three sides also present the characteristics
of Theban art, and it is a pity that the
fragment is so far unique. If the rest of the temple was
decorated in the same happy fashion, the XIVth
Dynasty encouraged at Thebes a work comparable to
the finest of the XVIIIth or XIXth on the porticoes
of Deîr-el-Baharî, in the sanctuary of Gournah, and in
the Memnonium erected by Setouî I at Abydos.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It is with the statues of the XVIIIth Dynasty discovered
at Karnak by M. Legrain as with those of the
XIIth: directly we look at them we notice distinctive
signs of the school, with modifications that are explained
when we consider the position of Thebes at that period.
The favourite residence of the Pharaohs and permanent
seat of their government, its prosperity was
continually increased by the booty gained in Syria or
Ethiopia, and as wealth increased, so did the taste for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
building. Not only did the kings never tire of embellishing
the city, but, following their example, private
individuals built sumptuous palaces and tombs there.
For so much activity a large supply of artists was
needed: studios multiplied, sculptors came from all parts
of the country to supplement the few Theban sculptors.
Those strangers did not join the local school without
exercising some influence on it: it was subdivided into
several branches, each of which, while preserving a
common ground of precepts and habits, soon assumed
its personal physiognomy. We already know two or
three of them, but how many must there have been
during the three centuries that the Dynasty lasted, all
the work of which is lost for us or confused with the
mass?</p>

<div id="il_22" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33em;">
  <img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="2617" height="3430" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>BUST OF THOUTMÔSIS III.</p>

<p>Grey Schist.</p></div></div>

<p>I like to attribute to the same studio, besides a
certain number of pieces recently acquired by the Cairo
Museum, three of the best fragments extricated by M.
Legrain from the <i>favissa</i>, the Thoutmôsis III, the Isis,
and the Sanmaout. The Thoutmôsis III is in a very
supple schist that allows the most delicate chiselling, and
no engraving can do justice to the delicacy of the modelling:
the play of the muscles is discreetly noted, but
with extraordinary sureness, and, the imperceptible
shadows it produces varying in proportion as we walk
round the figure, the aspect of the physiognomy seems
to change from moment to moment. Isis was not of
royal birth, and perhaps came from one of the lower
strata of society: five-and-twenty years ago her existence
was not suspected, and the Karnak statue in pink granite
is the first portrait we have of her. It is through her,
however, that Thoutmôsis III possesses the features
by which he differs from his predecessors, the large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
aquiline nose, wide-opened, almost protruding eyes, full
mouth, rounded face. The heavy wig he wears made
the sculptor’s task difficult; so much the greater then
is the merit in conceiving a work before which we pause,
even by the side of the preceding one. It contains all
the characteristics of the Theban school, the seeking
after the personal expression, the sincerity of the rendering,
the width of the shoulders and, as a set-off, the
intentional smallness of the waist between the ample
breasts and broad hips. Study of the composition compels
us to attribute it to the same studio, if not to the
same artist to whom we owe the statue of Thoutmôsis
III. I think the same about the group representing
Sanmaout and the little princess Nafêrourîya whose
steward he was: nothing could be less conventional than
the free, firm gesture with which he holds the child, or
the posture of trusting abandon with which she leans
against his breast. The frankness of the movement well
harmonizes with the spiritual gentleness of the face and
the smile that animates the eyes and the full lips.
Sanmaout was Queen Hachopsouîtou’s major-domo, and
his sovereign had authorized him to erect his statues in
the temple of Amon. After examining those that
remain to us, it cannot be doubted that they all come
from one of the royal studios, most probably the one
whence came later the statues of Thoutmôsis and his
mother Isis.</p>

<div id="il_23" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i_096a.jpg" width="1553" height="3066" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ISIS, MOTHER OF THOUTMÔSIS III.</div></div>

<p>And we have direct proof that the Theban sculptors
of that period tried above everything to make sure of the
likeness. They drew their subject over and over
again before definitely making the rough sketch, and
the dry climate of Egypt has preserved many of
their cartoons. Cartoon is not exactly the term, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
they used fragments of limestone for their studies,
but the word <i>ostraca</i> by which they are designated
is not much better, and, further, is only intelligible to
expert Egyptologists. Hundreds of them have found
their way to the Cairo Museum, and they show the
attempts of the artist, his hesitations and corrections, the
variations of his thought and of his hand, down to the
moment when he became absolute master of his model.
More than once, too, the chances of excavation have
brought the model itself to light, and provided us with
the means of comparing the portrait with the original.
That is the case with Thoutmôsis III. His mummy
was found in 1881 in the <i>favissa</i> of Deîr-el-Baharî
and is exhibited with the others in the Gallery of Sovereigns
in the Cairo Museum. The face has certainly
greatly changed in course of mummification, and the
shrunken flesh, the sunken eyes, the flattened nose, and
the discoloured skin make him very different from what
he was formerly. But if the superficies has changed, what
is beneath has endured: if we compare the profile of the
face with the mask of the statue, we must admit that
they are identical, with the addition of the life, the expression
of which was perpetuated by the sculptor.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>SANMAOUT AND THE PRINCESS NAFÊROURÎYA.</p>

<p>Black granite.</p></div></div>

<p>Let us skip a century and a half, and transport ourselves
to the last years of the Dynasty: they have
bequeathed us several pieces that must be related to a
common origin: the fine woman’s head that Mariette
called Taia, the Khonsou and the Amon of Harmhâbi,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
the Toutânoukhamanou, and perhaps also the statuette in
petrified wood extracted from the <i>favissa</i> by Legrain in
1905. Is not a portrait of Aî to be recognized there?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
It is broadly treated despite its restricted dimensions, but
the unfortunate material employed did not allow the
artist to go far as regards execution: the likeness remains
uncertain. But it preserves the mark of the school, and
various details in the nose, mouth, the cut of the eyes,
the inset of the eyebrows, lead me to think that we shall
probably be right in attributing it to the group of artists
to whom we owe the Khonsou and the Toutânoukhamanou.
I am certain that they come from the same hand, and an
instant’s examination will prove it. The two figures might
almost be superimposed: the eye is hollowed out in an
identical amount in both, the attachment of the nose is
similar, and so is the way of slightly inflating the nostrils
and of dilating the middle of the lips and compressing
the corners. The physiognomy has something ailing in it,
but the indications of ill-health, the obliquity and bruised
appearance of the eyes, the thinness of the cheeks and
neck, the prominence of the shoulder-bones, are more
perceptible in the Khonsou than in the Toutânoukhamanou;
we might say that the model of the Khonsou,
if it is not Toutânoukhamanou at a more advanced age,
had a more visible tendency to consumption. A doctor
should study them both: he alone could decide, if, as I
imagine, they represent a sick man, and possibly he could,
according to the external aspect of the subject, establish
the exact diagnosis of the disease.</p>

<p>The similarities are less marked in the head called
Taia, and they are not at once noticeable in the engraving:
but they are clear to those who have studied
the originals. In a slighter degree all the details I have
noted in Khonsou and Toutânoukhamanou are there: the
queen is not a sick woman, but the different parts of her
face are treated in the same way, and the hand which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
sculptured them is that which so delicately chiselled the
portraits of the god and the Pharaoh, its contemporaries.
Even when only the queen was known, her strange physiognomy
greatly excited the imagination of scholars.
Mariette, who discovered her, thought her a stranger to
Egypt; he identified her with Tîyi, the wife of Amenôthes
III, and declared her to be Syrian, Hittite, Armenian,
and his opinion long prevailed. We know now that her
date is at least a quarter of a century after Tîyi, and that
she represents the wife or mother of Harmhâbi, one of
the Pharaohs who succeeded the heretical sovereigns of
the XVIIIth Dynasty. And in fact the portraits of Tîyi
that have recently emerged from the earth have no point
of likeness with that of Mariette’s queen. They present
a woman of a thin bony type, with heavy jaw and long
depressed chin, a low receding forehead, the physiognomy
of the Pharaoh Khouniatonou with which the bas-reliefs
and statues of El-Amarna have familiarized us. By the
form and expression of her face our queen is allied to
the family of Harmhâbi or Toutânoukhamanou: the resemblance
of her statue to those of Legrain would
sufficiently prove it, if further proof were required.</p>

<p>And now, when the two groups I have just described
have been compared, it is easily admitted that the inspiration
and technique of the second proceed directly from
the inspiration and technique of the first. Taste fluctuated
during the five or six generations that divide them, and
the caprices of fashion have influenced the execution: but
the general characteristics remain unchanged, and their
persistence allows us once again to assert the continuity
of the school.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It maintained its flourishing condition during the
XIXth Dynasty, and the <i>favissa</i> has restored to us works
that yield in nothing to those of the preceding age. In
my opinion the best is a mutilated statue of Ramses II,
so like the big Turin statue in pose and execution that
it might be the first rough draft of it, or the exact
smaller copy. A few pieces of the XXth Dynasty are
worthy of esteem without rising far above mediocrity, as
in a little group in granite of Ramses VI bringing a
Libyan prisoner to the god Amon: the bearing of the
victorious Pharaoh does not lack pride, the constrained
posture of the barbarian is skillfully noted, and the movement
of the miniature lion that glides between the two
is interpreted with the customary naturalness of the
Egyptians when they portray animals.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> I prefer the
priest with the monkey, or, to give him his name,
Ramses-Nakhouîti, the chief prophet of Amon. In a
crouching posture, with calves and thighs flat on the
ground, a roll spread out before him across his legs,
bewigged and petticoated, uncomfortable in his robes of
ceremony, with an air of abstraction he meditates, or
silently recites prayers to himself. A little hairy cynocephalus
perches on his shoulders, and looks at him over
his head: it is the god Thot who is revealed in this
unusual position, and it was difficult to co-ordinate the
beast and the man in a manner that should be neither
absurd nor simply ugly. The sculptor has come out with
honour. The priest slightly bends his neck, but we feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
that the beast does not weigh on him: the monkey on
his part half shrinks behind the head-dress, and the deep
frown of his face prevents the mischievous effect that the
countenance of an animal above a human face might
have produced. Like the group of Ramses VI, it bears
the imprint of the school, but with notable differences of
technique: if the first was sculptured in one of the royal
studios, the second comes from another studio of which
the origin can be indicated.</p>

<p>We know how, about a century after the death of Ramses
III, the pontiffs of Amon made themselves masters of the
whole of the Thebaïd: while a new Dynasty established
itself at Tanis in the eastern delta, they exercised supreme
authority over Southern Egypt and Ethiopia, sometimes
with the title of high-priest, sometimes with that of king,
and their sacerdotal house was the seat of their government.
We do not know the exact site, but we learn
from an inscription that it was situated near the seventh
pylon, not far from the spot where the <i>favissa</i> was dug
out. It is probable that their relatives obtained the
privilege from them, at the moment they assumed
domination, of erecting their statues in the temple. The
court-yard between the seventh pylon and the hypostyle
hall contains only a small number of <i>ex-votos</i>: they chose
it as the place in which to consecrate their monuments,
and filled it in the course of generations. What has come
down to us does not include all they erected in their own
name or to the memory of those they loved. Many
statues were seized or destroyed during civil or foreign
wars, but when the Macedonians conquered the land
enough remained for more than five hundred to be
thrown into the <i>favissa</i>. A large number of artists must
have been needed to execute so many commissions, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
besides its royal studio, Thebes long possessed one or
several pontifical studios. To one of those must be
assigned the man with the monkey, and nearly all the
statues after the fall of the Ramessides. For the most
part they have a real value, and scarcely yield to the old
royal works, such as the limestone statuette of Orsorkon II,
who drags himself along the ground and offers a boat to
his god, the fragments of which have disappeared. We
are forced to confess, however, that many are, if not bad,
of no interest for the history of art.</p>

<p>The usual posture did not lend itself to elegance.
They are nearly all crouching, the thighs up to the
chest, the arms crossed on the knees: what advantage
was to be obtained from an attitude that reduced a
man to a mere packet surmounted by a head? Where
the model departed from the hieratical posture, the
qualities of the school are revealed. The Ankhnasnofiriabrê
en Hathor has a somewhat strained gracefulness:
it would almost bear comparison with the Amenertaîous
so much admired by Mariette, if it were not leaning
against a big ugly pillar. Perhaps the contrast between
the slender waist and the inflated bust and belly is too
marked in the Ankhnas, but the composition of the head
is irreproachable. It is nearly always so at that epoch:
if the sculptors sometimes neglected the bodies or interpreted
them ill, they cared lovingly for the heads. Fine
portraits may be counted by the score among the statues
found in the <i>favissa</i>. I shall only give two here, that of
Mantimehê and his son, Nsiphtah, who lived under
Taharkou and Psammetichus I. Thebes was then under
a curious government. When the male descendants of
the priests failed, the power, and those sacerdotal functions
that could be exercised by women, passed into the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
of the princesses: one of them was elected, who, wedded
to the god in a mystic marriage, henceforth enjoyed the
right of living free as she pleased. To assist them in
the government, these <i>pallacides</i> of Amon had major-domos,
who often filled with them a similar rôle to that
of the chief minister with the queens of Madagascar
before the occupation of the island by the French.
Mantimehê and his son are the best known of these
persons, and the artists to whom the care of sculpturing
their portraits was entrusted would certainly be the best
among those of the sacerdotal studio. It is, in fact,
nature itself, and no master of a former age could have
expressed better or with a bolder chisel the bustling
vulgarity of the father and the aristocratic inanity of the
son. The second Saïte period and the beginning of
the Greek period are almost entirely unrepresented in
the <i>favissa</i>; under the Persians, distress was too general
for artistic matters to be thought of, and the Macedonian
rule had only just been consolidated when the common
pit was dug. A granite head, of hasty workmanship
but dignified appearance, shows, however, that the Theban
studio followed the movement that prevailed in the
schools of Lower Egypt, and that, doubtless under the
influence of Greek models, it gave attention to details
hitherto neglected: the skull is studied with a greater
care for accuracy, and also the slight accidents of the
physiognomy, the furrows of the forehead, the lines
between the eyes and at the rise of the nose, the falling
in or puffing out of the cheeks, the play of the muscles
round the nostrils and mouth. The sculptor desired
to note in his work not only the broad lines of the face,
but the small details that characterize the individual and
determine his personality.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is a long time since I undertook to distinguish, under
the apparent uniformity with which Egypt is reproached,
the varieties of composition and conception that may serve
for the recognition of schools, and, in the work of the schools,
for that of particular studios. I have not found it difficult
to show how the Memphian manner differs from the Theban,
nor what distinguishes both from that which flourished at
Hermopolis, Tanis, Saïs; but for the lack of sufficiently
numerous documents, I had not succeeded in marking out
the development of one same school through a long series of
centuries. The find at Karnak gave me the materials I
lacked, and since M. Legrain has been exploiting it, I have
not ceased to search in it for information on that point. I
have obtained much there, sometimes, it is true, of varying
value, and I have still much to learn both about the most
ancient periods and about certain moments of transition
in more recent periods. I believe, however, the results
already obtained are sufficiently important and significant to
compel us to remodel the history of Egyptian art. I have
not ventured to do that here, but, short as the present essay
is, it may clearly be seen to what results it has led me. I
have confirmed the fact that the characteristics of Theban
art were those I thought I recognized at the beginning of
my studies: I then rapidly noted the stages that the art
passed through from the moment that Thebes awoke to
political life almost to that when it ceased to exist as a
great city.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE COW OF DEIR-EL-BAHARÎ<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor smaller">52</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">At</span> two o’clock in the afternoon of February 12, 1906, while
Naville was finishing his lunch, a workman came running
up to tell him that the top of a vault was beginning to
emerge from the earth. For several days certain
indications had led him to think that a discovery was
at hand: he went to the spot and at once saw in
the mound of sand that dominated the back porticoes
of the temple of Montouhotpou a spectacle that filled
him with joy. The vault was almost half dug out;
under it, in the shade, an admirable cow extended her
neck, and seemed to look about her curiously. A few
hours’ work sufficed to set her completely free. She
was intact, but a little figure leaning against her breast
had had its face crushed in distant ages, and the violence
of the blows had caused a crack in the head and shoulders
that compromised its solidity. The chamber that sheltered
the cow was built in a hollow of the rock with slabs of
sculptured and painted sandstone. The semicircular ceiling
did not present the usual regular vault with converging
keystones and surfaces; it was composed of a double row
of bent blocks cut in quarters of a circle and buttressed one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
against the other at their upper end. It was painted dark
blue with yellow five-pointed stars scattered over it to
represent the sky. The three vertical partitions were
decorated with religious scenes: on the one at the back
Thoutmôsis III worships Amonrâ, lord of Thebes, and
on the two sides he makes an offering to Hathor, who
is no other than the very cow shut into the vault.</p>

<p>She was still half buried when some ten inquisitive
persons turned their kodaks on her, thus despoiling Naville,
and disputing among themselves the pleasure of being the
first to photograph her. In the evening nothing else was
talked of in the Louxor hotels, and the tourists did not fail
to make up parties to go and admire her the next day.
The fellahs, on their side, related the most marvellous tales.
She had breathed noisily just at the moment that the light
of day touched her, and had shivered in all her limbs.
She had directed such a look on the workman who had
perceived her that he broke his leg with an awkward
blow of his axe. She was not, as she seemed to be, of
stone, but of fine gold, disguised by Pharaoh’s magicians
in order to keep off treasure-seekers: a few formulas
repeated at a fixed hour with the prescribed fumigations
and rites, a little dynamite, and after the explosion
the fragments would be transformed into ingots of
metal. And as if the sorcerers were not sufficient,
dealers in antiquities prowled about in the vicinity.
Doubtless she was too heavy for them to think of
carrying her off whole, but would they have found it
very difficult to detach the head and decamp with it
during the night, in spite of the vigilance of our
guards or with their complicity? Unscrupulous amateurs
are never far to seek, ready to pay heavily for a
stolen object, provided they believe it to have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
artistic or archæological value, and the certainty of
gaining hundreds of pounds in case of success largely
compensates the honest brokers of Louxor for the
petty annoyance of disbursing a few pence by way of
fine or of undergoing a week’s imprisonment if they are
caught in the act. I should have preferred to leave the
monument in its ancient place, but it would have been
tempting fortune, and the only means of saving it was to
send it to Cairo. I entrusted the matter to M. Baraize,
one of our engineers, and he carried it out extremely well:
in less than three weeks he had dismantled the blocks,
packed up the cow, and transported the cases by train
across the Theban plain. The chapel is now rebuilt in a
good position at the end of one of the rooms of the
Cairo Museum, but the goddess is not hidden in
darkness as at Deîr-el-Baharî. She stands at the
entrance, her body in the full light, the hinder parts a
little under the vault: she comes forth from her house
and shows herself freely to visitors, from the snout to
the end of the tail.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Our wonder is at first aroused by the mixture she
presents of conventional mysticism with realism. The
front view shows only the head surrounded by accessories,
the significance of which is only appreciated by those who
are learned in religious matters. At the top of the composition,
between the tall horns in form of a lyre, the
usual head-dress of goddess-mothers, is the solar disk flanked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
by upstanding feathers and stamped with an inflated uræus.
This scaffolding of emblems without thickness and almost
without consistence would run the risk of being broken
by the slightest blow if it was not supported, and so it
rests on two tufts of aquatic plants, the stalks of which,
rising from a socket near the hoofs, spring up right and
left of the legs; flowers alternating with buds bend over
the back of the neck and form a fan-shaped support behind
the disk and feathers. Under the snout, and as if framed
by the vegetation, is the statuette of a man standing, his
back to the cow’s chest. As I said, the face is mutilated,
the flesh black; he stretches out his hands, palms downward,
in front of him with a gesture of submission, as if avowing
himself the humble servant of Hathor: by the uræus of
the crown and the stiff petticoat spread in a triangle in
front of the thighs, we guess him to be a Pharaoh. He
is found again in a less punctilious attitude under the
right flank of the statue. He is kneeling, naked, and his
flesh is red; he presses the teat between his hands, and
drinks greedily of the sacred milk. If we may believe
the cartouche engraved between the lotuses, the two figures,
the black and the red, are one and the same sovereign,
Amenôthes II of the XVIIIth Dynasty, and perhaps
that is the case. But it was Thoutmôsis III who built
the chapel, and it is he that the artists have represented
twice over, praying in front of the cow and sucking the
udder. It would be strange if, after erecting the sanctuary,
he should have omitted to provide it with his goddess.
It is more probable that the cow was commissioned by
him, and shut up there by his order, but without dedication
or cartouche: he considered doubtless that the neighbouring
bas-reliefs would constitute sufficient title-deeds. Later,
Amenôthes II, wishing to associate himself with his father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
act of piety, and noticing an empty space behind the
coiffure, inscribed his name there.</p>

<p>Such a complexity of figures and attributes does not
tend to make the appreciation of the work easy for us,
and we have also to add the prescriptions of the ritual to
the conventions of the craft from which Egyptian artists
were never free, at least when stone was their material:
the belly, tail, legs, all the lower parts of the group, are
enclosed in a stone partition which spoils the effect even
while it preserves them from the chances of breakage.
And yet, despite defects that shock a sculptor of our time,
one glance suffices to reveal the extraordinary beauty of
the work. The head differs from that of our European
cows, but it is a question of race, and whoever has seen the
Soudanese cow of the present day will easily distinguish
its features in the Hathor of Deîr-el-Baharî: the fullness
of the brow, the subtle modelling of the temples and
cheeks, the gentle widening out of the snout, the suppleness
of the nostrils, and the smallness of the mouth. Such
accuracy of detail will delight the naturalist, but it might
be feared that it would harm the artistic value of the
whole. That is not the case at all, and if at a distance
the physiognomy seems to have only an expression of
gentleness and meditative somnolence, as soon as we go
near it assumes an air of intelligent attention. The eye
seems to grow larger and to follow the visitor who arrives,
the snout to contract and palpitate, as if to scent out. The
sculptor, instead of following the tradition and polishing the
stone as highly as possible, has respected the fine furrows
of the chisel, and the light playing on them gives at
moments the illusion of a shudder running over the skin.
The body is of equally accurate composition, the chest
narrow, shoulders thin, spine long and saddle-backed, leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
long and slender, the thigh sinewy, the haunches prominent,
the udder only slightly developed. The hinder part is
worked with an incredible fidelity. Contrary to custom,
the coat is red-brown, darker on the back, lighter, of a
tawny shade that becomes white, on the belly; it is speckled
with black spots, like flowers with four petals, which we
should consider artificial, if there were not animals of
Soudanese origin in the Egyptian herds of to-day that
show similar markings. By those spots they recognize
among the heifers of the year the one in which Hathor
has deigned to become incarnated, and which must be
worshipped as long as she remains on earth.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>She was, above all, the divinity of the dead. The
buildings scattered about that corner of the necropolis
were not exclusively consecrated to the gods of the living;
they were the chapels attached to royal tombs, some of
which, like that of Montouhotpou, were contiguous to
the tomb, while others, like that of Queen Hachopsouîtou,
for example, were relegated to the other side of the
mountain, in the Bibân-el-Molouk. The sovereigns were
sometimes praying and bringing offerings to the gods,
sometimes associated with them and taking part in their
sacrifices. Hathor, ruler of the West and lady of the
heaven, had become by a concourse of ideas, the reasons
of which can be understood, the mistress of souls and
<i>doubles</i>: she played thus a part of great importance in
places where the worship of her vassals was celebrated.
Walk through the halls of the large terraced temple and
you will find her repeatedly with the figure and posture
assumed by her in the oratory discovered by Naville: she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
is the foster-mother whose milk Thoutmôsis and Hachopsouîtou
are greedily imbibing. The suckling of the sovereign
was not a mere metaphor of language, realized and transcribed
on stone, but a material act borrowed from the
customs of Egyptian law, and the final formality of the
ceremonies of the adoption. The woman who had no son
to perpetuate her memory, and desired to have one, after
reading the preliminary passages, had to offer one of her
breasts, in all probability the right, to the youth or man
she had chosen; he would press the teat between his lips
for a few seconds, and by this pretence of feeding would
become to her as a son. Among half civilized peoples
where this custom prevails, it is not required that the
woman has been or is still married: only, the young girl
who acquires a child by this method covers her breast with
a thin stuff before going through the ceremony. If, then,
Thoutmôsis III, or by usurpation Amenôthes II, was
represented kneeling under the right teat of the Hathor,
he wished thereby to prove that she was his divine mother,
and the complacent manner in which she yields him her
milk sufficiently shows that she admitted the legitimacy
of his claim.</p>

<div id="il_41" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31em;">
  <img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="2439" height="1864" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">AN UNKNOWN FIGURE AND THE COW HATHOR.</div></div>

<p>But these are only half the ideas expressed by the
group, and it remains for us to determine the meaning
of the flowering lotuses which stand at the right and left.
As sovereign of the West and of the lands in which the
dead sojourned, she assumed different forms according
to the provinces. In the North the people imagined her
under the aspect of one of those fine sycamores which
grow in the midst of the sand on the borders of the
Libyan Desert, rendered green and thick by the hidden
waters sent them by the infiltrations of the Nile. The
mysterious path which leads to the shores of the West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
brings the <i>doubles</i> to her feet; as soon as they are arrived,
the divine soul, lodged in the trunk, thrust out the half
or the whole of her body, and offered them a vase full of
pure water and a tray filled with loaves. If they accepted
her gifts—and they could scarcely refuse them—they
confessed at once that they were her vassals; they were
no longer authorized to return to the living, but the
regions of the world beyond the tomb would open to
them. In the nomes of the Saîd where she was imagined
to be a cow, she haunted a fertile marsh situated on the
slopes of the Libyan mountains; whenever a <i>double</i> came
to its edge she stretched forth her head from among the
herbage to meet him, and claimed his homage, and when
he had paid it, she allowed him to enter the realms of
the funereal gods. The 186th Chapter<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> of the “Book of
the Dead,” a very favourite one with devout persons
under the second Theban Empire, initiates us into this
myth, and the vignette that precedes it shows us the
scene as the Egyptians conceived it: the red or yellow
slopes of the mountain, the tufts of aquatic plants, the
cow conferring with the defunct. The Pharaoh who
commissioned our group—or rather the sculptor who
executed it—combined the idea common to all with the
royal concept of the adoption by the goddess, and he
expressed the result therefrom as completely as the processes
of his art permitted. He reduced the marsh to
two slender clusters of lotus, and marked the two chief
points of the adoption by means of two little royal
figures and their attributes. The first, as we have seen,
wears the costume of the Pharaohs and has black flesh;
standing upright under the animal’s snout, it faces the
spectator. Amenôthes II has just arrived in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the cow and addressed to her the prayer in which he
conjures her to aid him in his journey in search of the
everlasting cities; his colour indicates that he is still the
slave of death, but the goddess has already enrolled him
among her adherents, and presents him to the universe
as her well-beloved son. That formality over, he slips
through the verdure, kneels down, and crushing the teat
in his hand, greedily puts his lips to it. That is the final
rite of the adoption, and also the pledge of his return
to normal existence. Scarcely has he swallowed the first
mouthfuls of milk than life enters his veins; the artist
has represented him naked as a new-born infant, and
painted his flesh red, the colour of the living.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The two forms of Hathor welcoming the dead are not
each confined to the province in which it was born. They
gradually spread over the whole country, not without
experiencing diverse fortunes. Hathor in the tree was
reserved for papyri, stelæ, and bas-reliefs. The first idea
was scarcely suitable for statuary, and the cleverest
sculptor would have been embarrassed to derive a large
tree from the stone, a goddess lost in the branches, a
person in prayer before the tree and before the goddess.
But it lent itself to painting, and some of the vignettes in
which it is expressed in the excellent copies of the “Book
of the Dead” or on the walls of the Theban hypogeums,
show us the admirable way in which the designers of the
new empire used it. Nothing could be more varied or
skilful than the relations they establish between the
woman and the sycamore on the one hand and the dead
person on the other. He is sometimes accompanied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
his soul, a big hawk with human head and arms, which
mimics his slightest gestures: while the <i>double</i> receives
the elixir of youth in his clasped hands, the soul turns
a runnel aside for his own benefit, and greedily drinks
from it. Colour adds its charm to the composition, and
the replicas of the subject to be seen at Cheîkh Abd-el-Gournah
in the hypogeums of the XVIIIth and XIXth
Dynasties would obtain a place of honour in our museums,
if it was permitted to detach them and mount them in
separate panels.</p>

<div id="il_42" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31em;">
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="2452" height="1887" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">PETESOMTOUS AND THE COW HATHOR.</div></div>

<p>Hathor in the marshes was entirely suited to the
ordinary conditions of sculpture, and if in some places
serious difficulties were presented, I have indicated how
the Theban masters overcame them. She provided a fairly
frequent theme for the studios, and the Cairo Museum
possesses three examples. They are smaller than the Deîr-el-Baharî
group, and do not unite the two concepts of
the adoration and the adoption. Consequently the lotus
is wanting and the dedicatory figure at the cow’s udder.
They are the affair of simple private persons who had
no right to proclaim themselves children of the goddess.
If they had attempted to touch the breast of Hathor
they would have usurped one of the privileges of royalty;
they appear then only once in each group, standing or
crouching in front of the chest. In one, which is in
grey schist and measures nearly four and a half feet long,
the donor has lost his head and neck, and he lifts up
a table of offerings with both hands in front of him; the
cow also is decapitated.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> No trace of inscription is to
be seen on the pedestal, but the composition is that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the first Saïte period. The piece, although not the most
mediocre that could be found, lacks originality; it is the
work of a skilful journeyman who had no personal inspiration,
and only knew how to apply the formulas of the
school conscientiously. The second group is in yellowish
limestone. It measures not quite three feet in length
and has suffered more than the preceding one.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Not
only has the animal’s head been destroyed, but its tail
and one of its hind legs have vanished. The man is
mutilated to the point that only one of his feet remains
to prove to us that he was kneeling. He bore a table
of offerings. An inscription engraved on the edge of the
pedestal informs us that he was called Petesomtous,
and the name, together with the style, takes us back to
the Saïte period, perhaps to the period of the Persian
domination. The composition is, besides, sufficiently
rough, and it would not deserve any attention if the
interest of the subject did not compensate for its insignificance
as a work of art.</p>

<div id="il_43" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">

  <div class="caption"><p>PSAMMETICHUS AND THE COW HATHOR.</p>

<p>Three-quarters view.</p></div></div>

<p>The third was celebrated from the moment of its
discovery. It is in green schist, slightly over three feet
in length, and under it in height. It was found by
Mariette at Saqqarah, fifty years ago, in the tomb of a
certain Psammetichus, a contemporary of the first Nectanebo.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
It was accompanied by two fine statues of
Osiris and Isis,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> which are the glory of the Cairo Museum,
and we owe them for a certainty to the same artist. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
posture of the cow is the same as that of Deîr-el-Baharî;
like her, the head-dress is formed of the solar disk with
the uræus surmounted by two long feathers, but a
<i>monaît</i> fastened round the neck by its chain lies flat
on the spine. Psammetichus stands under the head, his
back to the chest, his hands hanging down over the
apron, with the same gesture of submission as that
of Amenôthes II. Besides his name and protocol,
the inscriptions contain a prayer for his happiness, addressed
to the benevolent Hathor. The hardness of the
material has prevented the sculptor from completely freeing
the fragile parts: the cow’s legs and belly are sunk
in the stone, as are the back and feet of the man; the
head-dress is supported by a semi-cone set in the back
of the neck, and the ears are reinforced by a pad which
doubles their thickness. The sculptor, embarrassed by the
necessity of preserving masses of superfluous material,
had the ingenious idea of treating the lower limbs as a
bas-relief. He has designed them on each side of the
panel that supports the belly, so that Hathor has two
chest profiles and a double supply of legs. He has so
cleverly arranged this superabundance of legs that it is
not noticeable at a first glance, and some effort of thought
is required to make sure that it exists. But despite these
eccentricities the work is of rare perfection. Never has
such hard stone been manipulated with greater suppleness;
the outlines have a harshness that all the virtuosity
of the execution has not been able to prevent, but the
modelling of the bodies and the faces, both of the
animal and of the man, is of unparalleled delicacy, and the
whole breathes serenity mingled with melancholy. It is,
as a piece of animal sculpture, the best that has come
down to us in Saïte art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, it loses when compared with the schist
group of the time of Amenôthes II. The mythological
element is less predominant, and the head gains by not
being framed by two tufts of aquatic plants: but if the
religious convention is less encumbering, the artistic convention
and the conventions of the studio come out in a
much more apparent fashion. The Saqqarah group belongs
to the Memphian school, and, as with nearly all the
products of that school, the form has something artificial
and impersonal. Hathor is a symbolic cow, the half-abstract
type of Egyptian cows, a type that in the eyes
of the Memphians realized the ideal of the earthly or
sacred cow: she has the elegance, but also the softness
and the rather insipid meekness, which distinguishes the
human figures. The Hathor of Naville, on the contrary,
belongs to the Theban school, and possesses the characteristics
that I have described above.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> The royal studio
whence it came was governed by the theological laws, and
was forbidden to modify in any way the types that, in
the course of ages, had been determined on for revealing
the concepts of popular tradition or learned dogma, but
it tried to keep their expression as near to life as the
rites authorized. The artist who produced the Memphian
Hathor chose a pattern from his cartoons, and translated
it into stone without troubling to correct the banal purity
by imitating a beast of the sacred herd. The sculptor to
whom we owe the Theban Hathor, on the contrary, while
preserving the ritual arrangement of the parts and the
accumulation of the symbols, has placed them on a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
cow, on the cow, perhaps, that for the moment incarnated
the goddess in the neighbouring temple of Queen Hachopsouîtou.
Imagine her without the emblematic surroundings
he was compelled to give her—the heavy
head-dress, the lotus tufts, the two statuettes of the
Pharaoh—and you will have the good motherly creature
who goes peaceably to pasture, and, as she goes, observes
everything with her eye, inquisitive and dreamy at the
same time. Neither Greece nor Rome has left us anything
that can be compared with it; we must go to the
great sculptors of animals of our own day to find an
equally realistic piece of work.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STATUETTE OF AMENÔPHIS IV<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>The Louvre</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> statuette originally formed part of a group. The
lower part has been fairly skilfully restored in modern
times: the upper comes from the Salt collection,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and,
like most of the objects of that collection, was found at
Thebes. It represents Amenôphis IV of the XVIIIth
Dynasty, the first in date of the Pharaohs we are accustomed
to name the heretic kings.</p>

<p>In making only a cursory examination we are
struck by the ways in which it differs from the royal
statuettes that have come down to us. The Pharaohs are
usually seated with the head erect, the bust firm, in a
posture of stiff dignity which did not lack grandeur.
Here the royal stiffness has almost wholly disappeared.
The head leans slightly forward, the bust sinks down, it
seems as if the body, powerless to hold itself up, is going
to slip off the seat; the abandon of the posture is in
entire harmony with the character of the person. The
back is slightly rounded, the hips are larger than are
suitable for a man, the belly and chest inflated; the
breasts are round like those of a woman, the puffed-out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
torso is wrinkled in folds of fat, the face is weak and
good-natured. In all that, the artist has set aside the
æsthetic rules usual in Egypt. If it were not for the
awkward angle formed by the arm that holds the sceptre
and the whip, and the bad execution of the hand that
rests on the left thigh, his work might be quoted as an
excellent specimen of what a conscientious sculptor could
do at the best moments of Theban art between Thoutmôsis
III and Setouî I.</p>

<p>I do not believe that in the long series of Pharaohs
there is a prince who has been so badly treated by contemporary
scholars as he has been, and about whom they
have allowed greater rein to their imagination. At first,
the roundness of his body and the exaggeration of his
breast caused him to be taken for a woman: for a long
time Champollion characterized him as a queen, and was
only convinced of his error with difficulty. Later, Mariette
thought he recognized in him the exterior signs of a
eunuch. Contemporary monuments assign him a wife
and children, and we can find a way of reconciling this
embarrassing posterity with the new theory. It suffices
to suppose that, after having been married and become
the father of four daughters, he went to war with one of
those African tribes that have preserved to this day the
custom of castrating their prisoners: having fallen into
their hands, he would have left them as we see him.
Some Egyptologists have accused him of being an idiot,
the more moderate only regard him as a fanatic. Born
of a foreign mother, the white Taîa, brought up by her
to worship Canaanitish deities, he had scarcely ascended
the throne before he wished officially to replace the
worship of Amon by that of the solar disk, whose
Egyptian name, Aton, perhaps reminded him of the Syrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
name Adoni or Adonaï. This story is well imagined, but
to me it seems more than doubtful. Two proofs have
been advanced concerning the foreign origin of Taîa: the
pink colour of her cheeks and the curious form of the
names used in her family. The flesh of Egyptian women
was always painted pale yellow: if Taîa is pink, it is
because she was fairer than they, and consequently of
exotic birth. The argument was specious, but it is not
permissible to repeat it to-day. For it has been discovered
that in the time of Amenôphis II and Amenôphis III
the artists for some years employed pink tones for the
flesh of their personages, both men and women, and the
confirmation of that fact takes away any value from
the reasoning deduced from Taîa’s colour. Taîa has pink
flesh in the monuments because the fashion of the day
required that she should so have it, and not because she
possessed the fair complexion of the northerner. As to the
names of the members of her family, Iouaa, Touaa, they
do not seem to me to be Asiatic. Doubtless they are
not constructed in the Theban manner, but they are
found, and many like them, in the tombs of the Ancient
Empire. Far from proving a Canaanitish or Libyan extraction,
they take us back to the oldest periods of the
history of Egypt and denote a Memphian or Heliopolitan
origin.</p>

<p>If, as everything indicates, Taîa is not a foreigner, we
no longer have any cause to seek beyond Egypt for the
motives that made Amenôphis IV decide to proscribe the
worship of Amon. In fact, the religion of Aton that he
professed is indigenous in its formulas and ceremonies.
Aton is the solar disk, the shining globe lighted every
morning in the east in order to be extinguished every
evening in the west; for some theologians it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
visible body in which Râ, the solar god <i>par excellence</i>,
was the soul; for others the actual god, and not the
shining manifestation of the god. The Theban priesthood
had adopted the first theory, which better harmonized
with its monotheistic tendencies, and it had developed it
to the utmost: it had fused together all the forms of
the divinity, and only recognized in it the aspects, the
diverse conditions of one and the same being who was the
soul of the Sun, Amonrâ. The schools of Memphis and
Heliopolis, older than those of Thebes, had remained more
closely attached to the ancient polytheism, and interpreted
its doctrines in a more material sense. A fact that, so
far, no one has ever brought forward, proves incontestably
that the worship rendered by Amenôphis IV to Aton was
connected with that of the sun as practised at Heliopolis:
the high priest of Aton, the supreme head of the royal
religion, bore the same official name and the same titles
as that of Râ at Heliopolis.</p>

<p>If, however, the monuments tell us that the worship
of Aton was a form of the most ancient worship of Râ,
they do not so far assist us to determine the points
of detail in which it differed. The solar disk of
Amenôphis IV, the supreme god Aton, is recognized by
the rays terminating in hands that he darts on the earth:
the hands brandish the anserated cross, and bring life to
everything that exists. I am not sure that Amenôphis IV
invented this imagery: I like to think that in that, as in
everything, he was bound to follow tradition. The prayers
that accompany the figure of the god, the ceremonies
celebrated in his name, are all Egyptian; they present
that character of seriousness and sometimes of licence to
be observed at Denderah, and in all the places where the
sombre myth of dead Osiris does not rule. The bas-reliefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
that have preserved its physiognomy for us might
serve as an illustration for the picture drawn by Herodotus
of the great festival of Bubastis.</p>

<p>Having said that, it may be asked what motives
impelled Amenôphis IV to deny the gods of his fore-fathers
and to embrace a Heliopolitan religion. It should
be noted at once that his father, Amenôphis III, had
already set the example of a special affection for solar
worships other than that of Amon: we may then believe
that Amenôphis IV as a child was brought up in
particular devotion for Râ, and that later, a natural
result of his early education, he was desirous of imposing
his favourite deity on his subjects. But I do not think
that religious faith was the sole, or even the principal
reason of his cruel persecution of the priests and partisans
of Amon; politics probably were chiefly responsible.
Amon was, above all, the patron of Thebes: he had
made the greatness of the Theban Dynasties, and they,
in their turn, had exalted him above all his compeers.
The conquests in Syria and Ethiopia had not been
without benefit for Egypt in general, but they had been
specially advantageous to Amon; the greater part of the
booty had passed into his coffers, his priests filled the public
offices, and his chief prophet was the highest personage of
the empire after the reigning sovereign. Had there been
under Thoutmôsis IV an attempt similar to that which
delivered the last Ramessides to the pontiffs of Amon
and which raised Hrihor to the throne? I do not know;
but I believe the desire to counterbalance their power
weighed heavily in the favour shown by Amenôphis III
to other divinities, and that a definite wish to overturn
not only Amon, but especially his clergy, induced
Amenôphis IV to thrust Aton into the first rank. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
did not recoil from any means that would lead to
success. As the destiny of Amon was indissolubly bound
up with that of Thebes, so long as Thebes was the
capital, Amon and his priests would keep the supremacy.
Amenôphis IV, after changing his name, which was a
profession of faith in the excellence of Amon, for that of
Khounaton, “splendour of Aton,” founded a new capital
which he called the city of Aton; he installed there
a new priesthood which he richly endowed, and then
erased the name of Amon from all the monuments
throughout Egypt and even at Thebes. But the worship
of Amon had its roots too deeply implanted in the land,
and his priests were too powerful, for the king to prevail
against them. When he was dead, his successors gave
up the struggle: Aton returned into obscurity, his city
was deserted, and the name of the king, proscribed by
sacerdotal hatred, vanished with the buildings on which
it had been engraved.</p>

<p>His attempt was not without influence on art. The
necropolis of El-Amarna has told us the names of two
of the sculptors who helped to adorn the city during its
brief existence. Their works are distinguished from
earlier ones by a greater freedom of composition, and
particularly by greater realism in the reproduction of
the persons. The Amenôphis IV of the Louvre does
honour to their talent; it is the more valuable since
their works, treated with great ferocity by the Theban
reaction, have become very rare. We have a certain
number of bas-reliefs more or less mutilated, but very
few statues; that of the Louvre is, so far, a unique
work of its kind.</p>

<span class="subhead">FOUR CANOPIC HEADS FOUND IN THE VALLEY OF
THE KINGS AT THEBES<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor smaller">61</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Among</span> the principal objects discovered by Theodore
Davis in 1907 in the Valley of the Kings, in the secret
chamber where the heretic Pharaoh Khouniatonou was
buried with an equipment partly consisting of objects
that had belonged to his mother, Tîyi, there are four
alabaster Canopic jars of a rare perfection even for that
period of perfect execution. The body of the jar is a
little longer than is usual, slender at the base, bulging
out at the top, with a polish at once unobtrusive and
pleasing to the eye. An inscription had been engraved
on it, and so far as may be judged by the place it occupied,
was the ordinary dedication to the deities protecting the
entrails; but it has been effaced, then the place smoothed
over, and tinted with the colour of the surrounding part.
The touching up is accomplished with so much skill that
we can only here and there, beneath the transparence of
the glazing, guess at a few marks of the old writing. The
four lids are in the form of a human head, a very refined
head framed in the short wig with close rows of little flat
locks of hair: a golden uræus, now vanished, stood on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
forehead. As the face is beardless, and the whole of the
equipment except the coffin bears the name of Tîyi, the
Canopic jars have been attributed to the queen. I do not
share that opinion; I maintain that they belonged to the
Pharaoh, and that we should see his authentic portrait
in them.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="clear">No one who has seen the four heads side by side will
doubt that they represent one and the same person. The
insignificant differences to be noticed between them are
caused by unimportant technical details, or by breakages
in the stone, or by the action of damp, or the different
way in which time has treated the materials of which the
eyes were formed. The eyebrows consist of a fillet of
blue enamel encrusted on the edge of the arch, and the eye,
properly so-called, is also designated by a blue fillet, which
includes a cornea in white limestone, relieved with red
at the corners, and an iris of black stone. In some, the
eyebrow is gone. In others the iris has fallen, leaving
blind one or both the eyes, or, the whole having been
displaced, the eye has been brought forward as if the
person was suffering from the beginning of an exophthalmic
goître. Very different expressions of countenance are the
result, but under them all the same face is quickly
recognized: a longish oval, rather thin at the bottom, a
somewhat narrow forehead, a straight nose, thin where it
joins the face and turned up at the end almost like
Roxelana’s, delicate wide-opened nostrils, the sides thin
and nervous, a short upper lip, a small but full mouth,
a bony chin, pointed and heavy, joined to the neck by a
rather harsh line. None of the heads have been entirely
respected by time, and one of them has lost its nose, but
by good luck, rare in archæology, the best in composition
is also that which has suffered least: if the enamel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the eyelids is wanting, the eyes are intact and the
epidermis without scratches. I do not think that there
exists in the Egyptian sculpture of that period a more
energetic or living physiognomy: the mouth is closed as
if to retain the words that desire to escape, the nostrils
are inflated and palpitate, the eyes look keenly and
frankly into those of the visitor. With age, the alabaster
has taken on the dull complexion of the great Egyptian
ladies, always protected by the veil, which the sun can
never burn. So that it is not surprising that many
should have felt in looking at them that they were heads
of a woman, and, knowing the circumstances of the
discovery, imagined that they saw the most celebrated
woman there had then been in the Egyptian Empire,
the queen-dowager Tîyi.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>KING KHOUNIATONOU.</p>

<p>Alabaster Canopic head found at Thebes.</p></div></div>

<p>Strictly speaking, that is quite possible, for on the one
hand the head-dress and necklace into which the neck fits
are common to both sexes, and on the other, the features,
more accentuated than is usual with a woman, are not
so to the point of only fitting a man; directly, however,
they are compared with those of the portraits of Tîyi,
we are bound to confess that the resemblance is slight.
Two types of these have come down to us. In the
first, which is by far the most frequent, her face was
remodelled and symbolized in the studios of Thebes in
accordance with the customary formula for queens. The
colossal group of Medinet Habou, recently transported to
the Cairo Museum, offers, perhaps, the best example.
There, following the regulations, Tîyi is furnished with a
round, regular face, almond-shaped eyes, good cheeks,
straight nose, smiling mouth, and normal chin: there is
something about her which prevents us from confusing
her with the other princesses of her era, but she has preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
none of the peculiarities that compose her actual
physiognomy. That is no longer the case with the most
individual of the specimens of the second type, the soapstone
head that Petrie discovered at Sinaï, which is now
in the Cairo Museum. The right wing of the wig is
wanting, and the nose has been crushed by an unfortunate
blow on the left nostril, without, however, losing
anything of its essential form; a cartouche engraved on
the front of the head-dress tells us the name, and at the
first glance the portrait gives the impression of a good
likeness. It is not flattering. If we are to believe it, Tîyi
presented the racial characteristics of the Berbers or of
the women of the Egyptian desert: small eyes puckered
at the temples, a nose with a broad tip and contemptuous
nostrils, a heavy, sulky mouth with turned-down corners,
the lower lip dragged back by a receding chin like that
of a semi-negress: the receding chin alone forbids us to
identify her with the original of our Canopic jars. They
have certainly a family likeness, and it could not be
otherwise, for if I am right it is a question of mother
and son, but variations are to be noted in the son which
remove him from the type so clearly revealed in Petrie’s
statuette. That type, on the contrary, is preserved intact
in the admirable head in painted wood which has passed
into the collection of Herr Simon of Berlin. We might
even say that it is exaggerated, and that the eyes are
more oblique, the cheek-bones more prominent, the nose
more aggressive, the smiling muscles more sharply
evident, the mouth and chin closer to that of a negress.
I believe it to be one of Tîyi’s granddaughters who
became queen after the fall of the Heretic Dynasty:
her head-dress, which was originally that of a private person,
was afterwards modified to receive the insignia of royalty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Was she married to Harmhâbi, to Ramses, or to Setouî
I? The deviation between the group to which she belongs
and that of the Canopic jars is sufficiently great to force
us to give up the idea that they represent one person.
In addition, our Canopic sculptures possess only one uræus
on the forehead, as is customary with kings, while the
others have the double uræus which then begins to be
the etiquette with queens. That rule has exceptions, and
therefore I shall not deduce too strict conclusions from it:
but the absence of the second uræus is not less a somewhat
strong presumption in favour of the opinion that our
Canopic heads are those of a man and not of a woman.</p>

<p>Alabaster Canopic head found at Thebes.</p></div></div>

<p>If, however, they are portraits of a man, the circumstances
of their discovery compel us to declare that he
must be the king Khouniatonou; but how are we to be
convinced of this when we remember the grotesque silhouette
that the sculptors of El-Amarna have given him?
To believe them, he would have been physically a sort
of degenerate, tall, weakly, with hips and chest like a
woman’s, a neck without consistency, an absurd head, a
flat, almost non-existent forehead, an enormous nose, an
ugly mouth, a massive chin.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> He seems to have liked these
caricatures, and his friends, imitating him from a desire
to flatter him, altered more or less the shape of their own
bodies in order that they might resemble that of his.
Documents of different origins prove, however, that he
was not, or had not always been, the queer figure that is
attributed to him. The Louvre alone possesses two such
witnesses. The first, which came to the Museum in its
early days, is a charming statuette in yellow soapstone.
The king is seated, but he has lost the bottom of the legs,
which a modern restorer has skilfully replaced. He wears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the <i>coufeh</i> with hanging ends, the bust is bare; in his
right hand he holds the hooked staff and the sacred whip
emblems of royalty; the left hand is indolently stretched
over the thigh. The body is young, the muscling supple
and thick, and although he sinks down a little, he has
not the squat attitude we know so well. The face and
neck are somewhat slender, and contain the characteristics
that, exaggerated later, lent themselves almost naturally
to caricature. It is, in fact, the effigy of the young king
sculptured at Thebes at the time when he was only
Amenôphis IV, but when he demanded that he should
be represented as he was, or as he saw himself, without
reference to the conventional type of the Pharaoh. In the
second piece, a statue of which only the head and shoulders
remain, he is some years older. He is armed for war, and
his neck, too slender, has bent under the weight of the
helmet, as if thenceforth incapable of supporting it. It is
the profile of the bas-reliefs of El-Amarna with the rounded
spine and the particular curve that projects the head
forward; the forehead, nose and mouth only differ from
those of the statuette in that they are thinner. A plaster
mask in the Cairo Museum which Petrie considers to
have been moulded on the corpse immediately after the
sovereign’s death, but which is undoubtedly a studio
model, testifies to a condition of physiological degeneracy
that did not before exist. It presents the emaciated
features of the bas-reliefs and their bony texture, it is
true, but without their extreme exaggerations. When it
was question of a statue, the sculptor forbade himself the
liberties that his colleagues, commissioned to decorate the
tombs, allowed themselves with the master: he represented
him just as he was at the moment, and the
physiognomy was sufficiently original for him to be certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
of always deriving from it a work that would force the
attention of the spectators.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="clear">And now let us compare each of these pieces with our
Canopic heads. The profile of Khouniatonou helmeted
is not as strong as theirs, due perhaps to the contusions
undergone by the surface of the stone during a long
sojourn in a damp soil where saltpetre was abundant, but
each of the elements may be superposed and adjusted,
forehead, nose, eyes, mouth, chin, in an absolutely satisfying
manner: it merely seems that the artist of the
Canopic heads saw his model in better health than that of
the statue. The resemblance, although less complete,
with the statuette of yellow soapstone is still apparent.
No unprejudiced observer with the series in front of him
can come to any other conclusion than that we have in
it portraits of one and the same man. Leaving out the
slight differences due to the chisel, there is no more
deviation between the group of statues and the best of
our heads than there is between that and the three found
with it. There is divergence in one point only: in the
two statues the head bends and leans forward more or
less; in the Canopic jars it is erect without weakness. A
moment’s reflection will show that it could not be otherwise.
However greatly we are moved by the beauty of
the work, we must not forget that our four heads belong,
not to art pure and simple, but to industrial art, and that
their purpose imposed special rules on the master who
chiselled them. They were prosaic lids for the receptacles
in which the entrails of the Pharaoh were placed, and it
was necessary that the median axis of the vase properly
so-called should coincide exactly with that of the lid.
There was a question of equilibrium to be managed between
the two constituent elements of the Canopic jar; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
sculptor must straighten the neck of his model, and consequently
correct the impression of lassitude given by the
statues, by an appearance of vigour. If we examine the
portraits of Khouniatonou and his successors in company
of a physician, certain anatomical details that at the first
glance we did not trouble about—the depression of the
temples, the obliquity of the eyes, the contraction of the
sides of the nostrils, the pinching of the mouth, the attenuation
of the neck—assume an etiological value that the
archæologist was far from suspecting. Dr. Baÿ, studying
the faces of Khouniatonou, Touatânkhamânou, and Harmhâbi
with me, diagnosed symptoms of consumption more
or less advanced. If Khouniatonou died of the disease
when thirty years old, we need not be greatly surprised.</p>

<p>I do not insist upon this kind of research, in which
I am not competent, and I leave it to the reader to decide
if I have or have not proved the identity of the person
represented by our four heads to be that of Khouniatonou,
the heresiarch. One of them at least is a masterpiece, and
the others possess qualities that assure them a high place
in the estimation of connoisseurs, but to which of the
great Egyptian schools ought we to attribute them? We
may hesitate between two: the Theban, to which most of
the artists who filled the royal laboratories then belonged,
and the Hermopolitan, in the province of which was
El-Amarna, the favourite residence of the sovereign. It
was certainly the latter school that worked at the
hypogeums and sculptured the pictures. We find in them
its defects: harsh, rough composition, a tendency to caricature
the human form and to multiply comic episodes; but
also its good qualities: suppleness, movement, life, freedom
of execution. The few figures in alto-relievo that
have escaped destruction, those, for instance, that accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
two of the large front stelæ, are of the same style
as the bas-reliefs, but we do not find in them any of the
characteristics that we have noted as proper to the
monuments of the Louvre or to our Canopic jars. Just
as the others show an unfinished, worn aspect, these are
carefully finished in the least details: it is the perfect
chiselling and high polish of the Theban masters and their
strong, dignified way of posing the figure and expressing
the physiognomy of the model. Whoever has seen the
statues of Thoutmôsis III, Amenôthes II, the so-called
Taîa, and Touatânkhamânou in the Cairo Museum will
not doubt for a moment that our four heads are from the
hands of persons belonging to the same school: they
belong to the Theban school, and more particularly, I
think, to that portion of the Theban school which, a
few years later, decorated the temple of Gournah, the
Memnonium of Abydos, and the hypogeum of Setouî I.</p>

<span class="subhead">A HEAD OF THE PHARAOH HARMHABI<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>Boulaq Museum</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> whole is composed of about ten pieces, collected
in 1860 in one of the halls of the temple of Karnak, and
put together with plaster, for good or ill, by one of the
workmen belonging to the Museum. The cementing
was not always done with rigorous accuracy, and one of
the largest fragments, that which forms the centre of the
head-dress, is slightly out of the perpendicular. Last year
I tried to remedy the awkwardness of the restorer, but
without success; if an attempt was made to separate the
badly joined pieces, there would be a risk of reducing
them to powder. But the irregularities in the joining
are sufficiently slight not to injure the general aspect.
In its present condition it is just the mutilated bust of a
king with the uræus and the double crown on the brow;
the broken object that leans against the left side is the end
of a staff of office, terminated with a ram’s head, the
emblem of Khnoum or Theban Amon. If we would
form some idea of what the body was like, it is sufficient
to look at any of the statues with the insignia that adorn
the museums, that of Ramses II at Boulaq<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> or of Setouî I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
in the Louvre.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> The king was standing, with his back
against a sort of pillar covered with inscriptions, and
holding the staff in his hand: as he looked in certain
religious ceremonies when he escorted the ark of Amon-Râ
through the halls and court-yards of the temple. What
remain of the hieroglyphic legends do not give any name.
Mariette was tempted to recognize it as Menephtah, son
of Ramses II,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> but he has not anywhere explained
the motives that led him to that identification. The
lugubrious tone of the black granite spoils the first
impression, but an examination, even if only a superficial
one, soon reveals the subtlety of the work. The head,
under the enormous pschent, is full of charm and delicacy.
The face is young, with an expression of gentle melancholy
rare among the Pharaohs of the great Theban period.
The nose is straight, thin, and well attached to the forehead;
the long eye turns up at the temples. The wide, full
lips, somewhat tightened at the corners as if for smiling,
are boldly cut with sharply defined edges. The chin is
scarcely rendered heavy by the weight of the artificial
beard. Every detail is treated with as much skill as if
the sculptor had been manipulating a soft stone like
limestone, and not one of the materials that offer all the
obstacles possible to the chisel. The sureness of the execution
is carried so far that the spectator forgets the difficulty
of the work in order to think solely of its intrinsic value.
It is a pity that Egyptian artists did not sign their works:
the name of the master to whom we owe this deserves to
have come down to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>It remains to see who was the king whose portrait
he has transmitted to us. When a Pharaoh ascended the
throne, the sculptors of the city where he then was,
Memphis, Thebes, Tanis, or another, hastened to make a
certain number of copies of his portrait, full face or in profile;
these were immediately sent into the provinces, in
order that his face might be everywhere substituted for that
of the former sovereign on the buildings in course of erection.
Thus in the Boulaq Museum we have several series
of royal heads, some discovered at Tanis,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> some in the
Fayoum,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> others at Memphis,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> which show what was the
procedure in such a case. The type, once carefully fixed,
did not change during the whole of the reign. Ramses II,
who was nearly a hundred years old when he died, after
reigning for sixty-seven years, kept the features of a young
man even to his latest monuments. The rule contains
numerous exceptions, especially when it is a question
of statues commissioned in one of the capitals of the
country, and executed by artists who could see their subject
at close quarters and register the changes time
produced in his face. Of the two Chephrên exhibited at
Boulaq, one is young and smiling,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> the other old and
saddened by age.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> But if there are examples of sovereigns
who, ascending the throne early, were sometimes represented
as they were at different periods of their life, I
know of none who were rejuvenated by the sculptors when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
they reached the throne at a late age. The head of the
statue with which we are here concerned is that of a
young man, almost a youth, and that is sufficient for me
to rule out Menephtah. Menephtah was fifty at least
when he succeeded his father,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and his portrait, as it is to
be seen at Karnak, does not in any way resemble the
personage whose image is preserved in the Boulaq statue.
The other princes of the XIXth and XXth Dynasties,
Setouî II, Siphtah Menephtah, Amenmeses, Setinakht, of
whom we have only a few poor portraits, have no more
claim to be commended than their great predecessors
Setouî I or Ramses II: the disturbed times in which they
lived scarcely admitted of works of careful composition.
Like Menephtah, Ramses I was too old at his accession,
and besides, we have his portrait at Gournah. And,
moreover, the style of the piece recalls at first sight that
of the Turin statues belonging to the XVIIIth Dynasty,
and then we must eliminate <i>a priori</i> a certain number of
statues of which we possess the exact description. Neither
Ahmôsis I, nor the Thouthmôsis, nor the Amenhotpou have
anything in common with our personage; and for even
a stronger reason we cannot recognize in him the characteristic
physiognomy of Khounaton and Aî. Proceeding
from one exclusion to another, we come to restrict the
choice to three princes, Touatânkhâmonou, Sânakht, and
Harmhabi. Sânakht had only an ephemeral reign; Touatânkhâmonou
has only left us insignificant monuments;
Harmhabi, on the contrary, appears to have been one of
the most important sovereigns of his time. A young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
at the accession, he restored the temples of Amon despoiled
by his heretic predecessors, and re-established the Egyptian
power that had been weakened for a moment in Syria
and Ethiopia. Last year and this year I cleared away
the rubbish from two of the pylons he had built and
decorated at Karnak; his portrait was sculptured on them
numerous times, and the outlines are sufficiently well
preserved for us to see in the king of the bas-reliefs the
original of the Boulaq bust. I attribute the statue of
which Mariette found the remains to Harmhabi, the
Armaïs of the Greeks.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may observe that the fragments, when
carefully examined, show no trace of having been broken
by a hammer; the statue was not destroyed by the hand
of man, the case with a certain number of the monuments
at Karnak. The great earthquake of the year
27 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, which put the temple of Amon almost into the
condition in which we see it, brought down the ceilings
of the halls; all the objects underneath were injured by
the blocks or architraves then violently thrown to the
ground and crushed under the weight of the ruins. Our
Harmhabi did not escape the common lot: it needed
Mariette’s great patience to restore the little we possess
of him.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Ramses II,</span> Sesostris, having restored the portions of the
great temple of Phtah at Memphis, which bordered the
sacred lake on the west and south, had colossi erected in
front of the doors, destined to perpetuate his memory and
his features for all “who should come after him on the
earth, priests, magicians, scribes,” and who should recite
a prayer to the gods on his behalf. The sacristans
appointed as guides to the profane, and the dragomans
who act as showmen of the wonders of Egypt, never fail
to draw the tourist’s attention to these statues; it gives
them an opportunity to relate some amusing story like
those collected by Herodotus and transmitted to us by
him as authentic history. One day Darius I wished to
consecrate his image in the neighbourhood, but the high
priest opposed his purpose: “Sesostris,” he said, “has
conquered all the nations that obey you, and the Scythians
to boot, on whom you never succeeded in inflicting much
harm. There is then no reason why your monument
should be placed by the side of that of a Pharaoh whom you
have neither surpassed nor equalled!” When Memphis fell
and became Christian, the fame of the colossi died away.
When it perished and its temple of Phtah was dismantled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
stone by stone to serve for the building of Cairo, they
were thrown down, and for the most part cut up into
grindstones, whence they passed into the lime-kiln. One
of them, however, thrown from its pedestal and lying face
downwards on the ground, was covered with rubbish, and
preserved from destruction by that happy chance. Brought
to light by Caviglia at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, it had the good luck to please travellers, and owed
it to them to have escaped the mania for destruction
that possesses the fellahs.</p>

<p>All Europeans in turn who have visited Egypt have
admired it. It lies along the side of the path under the
palm-trees of Bedrecheîn at the bottom of a muddy ditch.
At the period of the inundation, water fills it and covers
the statue for some weeks; then it gradually reappears,
the shoulder and the leg first, then the bust and face, until
it is all high and dry again in its hole. Its Pharaoh was
standing, walking, the arms close against the sides. The
name of Ramses II is to be read on the cartouche
engraved on the buckle of the waistband that fastened his
petticoat. Nitre has destroyed one side of the face and
body, but what remains suffices to show the excellence of
the work. The profile is that of the young Ramses, with
low forehead, large aquiline nose, rather a large mouth, and
a haughty expression. The base is at some distance off,
and farther away still, to the south, a smaller colossus in
wood, débris of walls, and fragments of statues point
out the position of ancient chambers. The palm forest
which flourishes on the site harasses excavation and
prevents us from reconstituting the plan. The building
or group of buildings that our colossus adorned went along
the south bank of the sacred reservoir on which the
mysteries of Phtah and the Memphian gods were celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
on the canonical days. In spite of the long period
of time, alluvial matter has not succeeded in entirely
filling the lake. The place is marked by a noticeable depression,
and the earth which fills it, instead of being planted
with date-trees, is sown with corn; it is like a square basin
the edges of which are drawn downwards from the
surrounding ground. The rise of the river partly restores
the original aspect of the spot, but the setting of porticoes
and pylons which framed it has vanished; it is replaced
by clumps of big trees, under which is situated the village
of Tell-el-Khanzîr.</p>

<p>It seems that Mohammed-Ali formerly gave Ramses II
to England; the fact is not exactly proven, and to admit
it definitely a more serious authority than that of one
or several of the “Travellers’ Guides to Egypt” would
be required. The English have not availed themselves
of the doubtful tradition to remove the colossus: they
were satisfied to set it up again. They did not succeed
at the first attempt, and two trials made by Messrs.
Garwood and Anderson failed ignominiously enough.
General Stephenson, who long commanded the army, was
more successful. He first had the ambitious project of
setting the statue on its feet again, but as the subscription
opened for that purpose did not produce sufficient money,
he contented himself with raising it up above the level
of the inundation. The operations, conducted by Major
Arthur Bagnold, of the Engineers, were begun on January
20, 1887.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Having drawn off the water, he applied eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
lifting jacks of differing force along the body: the effort
was directed alternately to the head and the feet: as
soon as the whole mass was raised a little more than a
foot and a half, huge beams were slipped underneath,
and the hollow was filled up with broken potsherds
collected in the ruins of the ancient city, reduced to tiny
pieces and beaten so as to form a compact bed. The
work was finished on April 16th. The colossus now lies on
its back, the face to the sky. A pent-house shelters the
head; a thick brick wall surrounds it and protects it from
the gaze of the inquisitive crowd. Its guardian dwells
beside it in a small two-roomed house where Major
Bagnold installed him, and he only shows it to visitors on
payment of two Egyptian piastres: it costs about sixpence
to see it at the bottom of the new funnel in which it
is plunged. The “Service des Antiquités” employs a
portion of the tax in keeping it in good condition. Another
Ramses in granite and a stele of Apries found in the
neighbourhood were afterwards placed there, and complete
the little open air museum.</p>

<p>The Arabs call the colossus <i>Abou’l-Hol</i>, the father
of the Terror, like the great Sphinx. I do not know
what they think now that it is under lock and key
in its enclosure, but they were really frightened of it
when it was, so to speak, at large. The ancient Egyptians
believed that statues, human and divine, were animated
by a spirit, a <i>double</i>, detached from the soul of
the person they represented. The <i>double</i> ate, drank,
even spoke at need, and pronounced oracles; it has survived
the religion and civilization of the ancient people, but the
changes that have taken place around it seem to have
soured its character. It plays evil tricks on those who
approach its hiding-place, injures them, at need even kills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
them: Arab writers have a thousand tales of persons who
suffered because they imprudently attacked a monument
and the spirit that guards it. The means of rendering the
<i>Afrite</i> powerless is to destroy, if not the whole statue, at
least its face: that is why so many Pharaohs have their
noses broken or faces damaged. The spirit of Ramses II
walked in the palm forest at night, and it was therefore
imprudent to venture in the vicinity at twilight. Every
time that I was obliged to go that way at sunset, my
donkey-boy mumbled prayers and urged on his beast.
One evening when I asked him if he was afraid of some
<i>Afrite</i>, he entreated me to keep silence, assuring me that
it was ill to speak of such things, and that if I persisted
some accident would happen to me. In fact, my donkey
stumbled in the middle of the forest and threw me against
the trunk of a palm-tree: if the donkey-boy had not caught
me and averted the blow, I should have smashed my head.
From that time, whenever there was talk of the danger
in speaking disrespectfully of the spirit that lives in the
statue, what had happened to me was always quoted.
The whole of Egypt is full of analogous superstitions, the
greater number of which are derived from the ancient
beliefs, and have been transmitted from generation to
generation from the time of the Pharaohs, the builders
of the Pyramids.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">So</span> much has appeared in the newspapers about the
treasure unearthed at Dahchour last year by M. de
Morgan, that every one in Europe knows the number,
form, and richness of the objects it comprises; but among
those who have described and justly praised them, how many—I
do not say Englishmen or Germans, but Frenchmen
alone—know that the Louvre possesses a collection of
the finest Egyptian jewellery? Mariette was fortunate
enough twice in his life to find a number of magnificent
ornaments of great artistic value on the royal mummies,
at the Serapeum in the tomb of the Apis buried in
the reign of Ramses II by the care of one of the
sons of the conqueror, Khâmoîsît, high-priest of Phtah,
and regent of the kingdom for his father, and at Thebes
in the coffin of a queen of the XVIIIth Dynasty,
Ahhotpou I, who in her lifetime was the daughter,
sister, wife, and mother of Pharaohs. Mariette, artist
as he was, very skilfully brought out the interest of his
discovery, and the admirable idea it gave of the goldsmiths
of the seventeenth and fourteenth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
but he went no further. He had brought to light
so many monuments of importance for the study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
political history and of civilization, that he never had
time to dwell much on the secondary result of his works.
The jewellery of Ahhotpou is preserved in the Boulaq
Museum, where thousands of tourists admire it every
winter; that of the Serapeum is placed in the Louvre,
and usually obtains only an absent-minded glance from
the few visitors who traverse the solitudes of the Charles
X Museum.</p>

<p>It fills several compartments of a glass case that
stands in the centre of the historic hall. At first we
note a large gold mask, unfortunately damaged, and
grouped near it gold chains with five and eight strands
of extraordinary suppleness and perfection; amulets of
various shapes in felspar, red and green jasper, and
cornelian; scarabs, a buckle, an olive, a little column,
in the name of Khâmoîsît. A little farther on a second
series from the same source includes pieces, if not in
themselves more finished, more curious and more attractive
to a modern eye; the Lord Psarou, who was present
with the prince at the funeral of an Apis, did honour
to the mummy of the sacred bull. I imagine that the
greater number of our contemporaries have but vague
notions regarding the way in which the Egyptians wore
jewels. Men or women, their costume at first was
summary enough: the men protected their loins with a
cloth which scarcely reached the knee and left the bust
entirely bare; the women crept inside a clinging smock
which reached the ankle, went up to the pit of the
stomach, disclosed the breast, and was kept in place by
two straps over the shoulders. Jewellery served partly
to hide what the stuff left uncovered, at least with the
women. A necklace of several rows encircled the neck
and came down to the rise of the breasts; large rings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
were round the wrists, the upper part of the arm, and
the lower part of the leg. The hair, or rather the wig,
clothed the back and half the shoulder; a square plaque
suspended by a chain of beads or a leather strap
hung down below the necklace into the space between
the two breasts. That is what we call the pectoral. It
often looks like the façade of a temple, surrounded by a
torus, and surmounted by a curved cornice; portraits of
gods or sacred emblems were crowded on the surface,
and inscriptions scattered everywhere tell us the
name of the owner, accompanied generally by pious
formulas.</p>

  <div class="caption">GOLD PECTORAL INLAID WITH ENAMEL.</div></div>

<p>The buckle of Psarou must have served to fasten the
linen waistband which confined the loin-cloth, or the
band which went round the head and kept the head-dress
in place. His pectoral is one of the richest that
has come down to us. It is fashioned in a plaque of
green basalt, polished and sculptured with a precision
that is astonishing when we remember how imperfect
were the tools at the disposal of the Egyptians. The
central scarab is in very high relief against the flat background,
and the fidelity of the modelling is marvellous:
the smallest details of the head and corslet are rendered
with almost scientific truth. The two women who seem
to worship it on the right and left are Isis and Nephthys,
the two sisters of Osiris. The contours of their bodies
are cut in the gold leaf that frames the scarab. Another
pectoral of which I give a reproduction is of less delicate
workmanship, but the technique presents interesting
peculiarities. It has openings cut in it, and the design
of the parts is obtained by partitions of a very supple
gold, in which are set the scarab and the coloured glass
which relieve the uprights and cornice of the naos. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
scarab is in lapis lazuli, the dress of the goddesses in
brilliant gold, engine-turned to simulate the stripes of the
stuff. The mystical meaning of this design would not
escape any educated Egyptian. The scarab represents the
heart and life of man, where life resides; it is the amulet
which ensures to each man, living or dead, the ownership
of his heart. That is why it was given to wealthy
mummies, if not to all mummies: sometimes it was stuck
on to the skin of the corpse with bitumen at the rise of
the neck; sometimes it was set in the centre of a pectoral,
lost in the thickness of the swathings over the chest. As
every Egyptian, when he left this world, was assimilated
to Osiris and became Osiris himself, the heart and the
scarab passed as the heart and scarab of Osiris, over
which Isis and Nephthys watched, as they had watched
over Osiris; hence the figures of the two goddesses. They
warmed the heart with their hands, they recited the
formulas that prevented it from perishing, they kept off
evil spirits and the magicians who might have seized it
for their dark purposes. Religion provided the artists
with a subtle motive of decoration; while they never
went far beyond the primary idea, they varied its detail
and expression with much skill. The women are sometimes
standing, sometimes seated or kneeling; they extend
their arms in front of them, or lift them to their foreheads
like mourners, or let them hang down in token of
grief; the scarab rests on a boat or a lotus flower or an
altar, instead of floating in air, as in the jewel of the
Serapeum. Comparative study of all the scenes would
prove once again the Egyptians’ fertility of imagination
and their skill in ringing the changes on the most
hackneyed subjects.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>PECTORAL IN SHAPE OF A HAWK WITH A RAM’s HEAD.</p>

<p>The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>The pectoral in the centre belonged to Ramses II<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
himself, or, at least, was executed by his order, and as a
personal gift in honour of the Apis that was buried:
the cartouche name <i>Ousirmârî</i> is placed just below the
frieze, and serves, so to speak, as a centre for the
composition that fills the inside of the frame. There is
first a hawk with a ram’s head, with spread wings which
curve in order to frame the cartouche: in his claws he
holds the seal, the emblem of eternity. Lower, a large
uræus and a vulture spread their wings and enfold both
the hawk and the cartouche in mutual protection. Two
<i>Tats</i> symbolize eternity, and fill up the empty spaces in
the decoration in the two lower corners. The hawk with
the ram’s head represents the soul of the sun, the uræus
and the vulture are the patron deities of the South and
the North: together they defend throughout the whole
universe the king whose name stands between their
wings, and, by the intermediary of the king, the dead
man whose mummy wears the jewel.</p>

<p>Here again the figures are designed in panels of gold
encrusted with coloured pastes or small pieces of cut
stones. The whole is rich, elegant, harmonious. The
three principal motives grow in proportion as they
descend to the lower part of the picture, according to an
admirably calculated progression. The cartouche with its
dull gold occupies the centre; below it the hawk forms a
first band of iridescent tones, the lines of which, slightly
curved back, correct the stiffness of the long sides of the
cartouche; the uræus and vulture, one pair of wings seems
to serve for both, envelop the hawk and the cartouche
in a semicircle of enamels, the tones of which pass from
red and green to dark blue, with a boldness and a
feeling for colour that does honour to the taste of the
workman. If the general aspect makes an impression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
heaviness, it is not his fault; the form of the jewel
imposed by religious tradition is so rigid in itself that
no combination can correct the effect beyond a certain
point. The rectangular or square frame, the cornice at
the top, the two rams’ heads which fit in below the
cornice, form a squat and massive whole. To fill the
interior suitably, it is impossible to avoid adding to the
heaviness; in manipulating the empty spaces a slender
and narrow appearance is procured, as in one at least of
the pectorals of Dahchour. The type of the jewels has
its origin in the same ideas or notions whence Egyptian
architecture and sculpture are derived: it is monumental,
and seems to have been conceived for the use of gigantic
beings. The usual dimensions of the pectoral are too
enormous for the adornment of ordinary men and women.
They only come into their own on the breasts of the
Theban colossi: the immensity of the stone body on
which their image is sculptured lightens them and seems
to bring out their exact proportions.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Egyptians left aside the square form
bequeathed to them by their ancestors; the sacred bird
left his cage when he could. Mariette found two of these
simplified pectorals at the Serapeum, both of which represent
a hawk: the first has its ordinary head and bends its
wings back, the other has assumed the ram’s head and
keeps its wings straight. It has the same wealth and the
same elegance of line as in the other objects of similar
source, but the motive, rid of the enamelled frame in which
it was stifled, possesses more charm and is better suited
to humanity. The execution is wonderful, and the ram’s
head, in particular, surpasses in suppleness of workmanship
all that is so far known. It is cut in a little ingot of pure
gold, but it is not the material that is of most value: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
old chaser knew how to model it broadly, and has given
it as faithful an expression as if he had cut it life-size in
a block of granite or limestone. It is no longer, as everywhere
else, industrial art: it is art pure and simple. Mariette,
and he understood, considered that he had never come
across anything approaching this among the Egyptian
jewellery he had seen. The gold ring also belongs to
Ramses II. The two little horses who prance on the bezel
were celebrated in history. They were called <i>Nourit</i> and
<i>Anaîtis-contented</i>, and were harnessed to the royal chariot
on the day of the battle of Qodshou, when Ramses II
charged in person the Khitas who had surprised him. The
Pharaoh remembered the service they rendered him on
that memorable occasion. The chiselling, although not
so good as that of the hawk with the ram’s head, is
very fine: it reproduces very boldly the particular
attributes of Egyptian horses, their exaggerated mane,
rather thin body, slightly swollen extremities. It is true
that the rings, as a rule, are not adorned with subjects
in such strong relief: the bezel is composed of a scarab
or a metal cartouche turning on a pivot, sometimes engraved
with the name of the wearer of the jewel, but more
often with a pious formula or a series of symbols of obscure
meaning by way of inscription. The larger number of
the rings we see in the museums belonged to mummies,
and are amulets that give the dead man some sort of power
over the inhabitants of the other world: a small number
only were used by their owners in their lifetime. They
are seals, affixed to deeds like our stamps, just as we
affix our signature. They are in every material: gold,
electron, silver, bronze, copper, enamel, even in wood,
according to the wealth of the individual; some are
veritable masterpieces of engraving, but many possess no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
more artistic value than the common copper seals bought
ready prepared at our stationers’.</p>

<p>The largest of these jewels passed through so many
hands before reaching the Louvre that they have sensibly
suffered: the panels are warped or even broken, the enamels
or encrusted plaques are here and there worn off. The
Dahchour jewellery, coming direct from the excavation,
has preserved an appearance of freshness which has not
a little contributed to increase the admiration of the public:
the objects seem scarcely to have left the hands of the
goldsmith who fashioned them, and the surprise we experience
in finding them still so fresh after more than four
thousand years renders us indulgent towards the imperfections
that a close examination soon reveals. Their
extreme antiquity, and quite rightly, counts for much in
the appreciation they receive. It is indeed strange to confirm
that from the twenty-fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Egyptians
had carried the technique of precious metals and the art
of making jewellery to a very high degree of perfection.
This was, of course, already known, for it is not infrequent
to find rings, fragments of necklaces, isolated pectorals, some
of which perhaps go back to the Ancient Empire, while others
belong to the Roman period or betray Byzantine influence:
our museums possess them by tens, and there is scarcely
a private collection that has not a certain number of them.
But these isolated objects do not attract the attention of
the public; to rouse its curiosity it is necessary that some
happy chance should bring to light a considerable treasure
in which specimens of all the types usually collected piece
by piece are placed together. Fortunately, these finds are
not so rare as might be imagined: if Gizeh can boast of
possessing the substance of Dahchour and the queen
Ahhotpou, the Berlin Museum has the admirable ornaments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
that Ferlini obtained from one of the Ethiopian
pyramids; the Leyden Museum and the British Museum
shared the spoils of one of the Antouf kings of the XIth
Dynasty; and the Louvre carefully preserves the jewels
of the Serapeum, the most beautiful of all.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Once</span> more chance has served us well. Workmen who
were making a railway embankment on the site of
ancient Bubastis discovered, on September 22, 1906, a real
treasure of jewellery and Egyptian goldsmiths’ work in
the ruins of a brick house. They hoped to profit by the
find themselves, but one of our watchmen had seen them;
he took no action, however, at the moment, for fear of
being ill-treated: the next day he reported the matter to
the native inspector, Mohammed Effendi Chabân, who
at once put the police on their track and informed his
chief, Mr. Edgar, inspector-general of the antiquities in
the provinces of the delta. Investigations were made
in likely places, while the police searched the workmen’s
houses and recovered some of the pieces that had been
carried off. Several that escaped them fell later into the
hands of a dealer in Cairo: a gold strainer, three undecorated
silver phials, a large chased gold ring which
strengthened the neck of a silver vase, fragments of silver
cups, all, except the gold ring, of no artistic value. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
two most valuable, a silver vase with a goat in gold as
handle and a gold goblet in the form of a half-opened lotus,
were seized at the house of the fellahs, Moursi Hassaneîn
and Es-Sayed Eîd, before they had sold them to a local
Greek <i>bakal</i>. He immediately claimed them of us as his
personal property that, failing our unfortunate interference,
he would have acquired for ready money. As no reply
was vouchsafed to his summons, he went to law with us.
The affair dragged on for some weeks, during which Mr.
Edgar had the railway works carefully watched. At last,
on October 17th, a workman with a blow of his pick-axe
laid bare several fragments of silver vases: he tried to
conceal them, but our <i>ghafirs</i> prevented him, and the
search proceeded under the protection of the police: the
objects lay in a heap, gold between two layers of silver;
the same evening they were in safety. The work was
carried out so quickly that nothing was lost, and
there was no reason for any one to contest our right to
the windfall. To bring this story to an end, I may add
that on November 4th the court of Zagazig found the
two fellahs guilty of theft, and condemned them to imprisonment
and to pay half the costs. But the <i>bakal</i> still
persisted in his claim, and rumour soon spread among the
natives that he had gained his suit in the Court of Appeal:
we had been forced to deliver up to him the objects of
the litigation under penalty of a considerable fine for each
day of delay. The dealers never hesitate to spread lies
of this sort among the people: they thereby enhance their
prestige with the fellahs, and uphold them in the notion
that they have nothing to fear from the “Service des
Antiquités.”</p>

<p>The treasure safe, we had to take note of the condition
in which it reached us. At the first glance, two very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
different series were perceived: one, which comprised the
jewellery and the gold or silver vases of most skilful
workmanship, went back to the XIXth Dynasty; the
other was composed exclusively of silver plate, the
coarseness of which betrayed a much more recent period.
Although it was all found at two separate times, and
in two places somewhat distant from each other, did it
originally form one collection? As we have seen, the
whole made a heap among the débris of two or three jars
which were themselves broken in the course of centuries
under the continuous pressure of the earth; the objects
seemed to have been heaped up irregularly, the most
valuable in the middle, the others forming a bed above
and below. We had even still adhering to a large
fragment of pottery a stem partly of hardened mud and
partly of metal, in which we recognized on a precipitate
of less ancient earrings and bracelets, the remains of
several Pharaonic goblets. How can it be explained that
relics of such different epochs should be found in the same
place? Many of them are intact, but others have
purposely been clipped or broken, and the fragments melted
down; they are also mixed with plates of pliant silver and
with ingots coming from goldsmiths’ workshops like those
that still exist. We know what happens not only in Egypt
but in European countries when peasants dig up treasure
while ploughing their land: they take it to a jeweller, who
buys it of them by weight, throws it into the melting-pot,
scarcely ever troubling about the loss thus caused to
art or science, and transforms it into modern horrors. It is
to some adventure of the sort that we owe the possession
of our find. A fellah who lived, I imagine, during the
time of the Roman domination, found in the ruins near
Zagazig, if not at Zagazig itself, silver objects which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
sold to a native goldsmith who destroyed some of them
for the needs of his craft, and kept the others either
to give to a collector or to use himself in the same way
as the first lot when that should be exhausted. Did local
sedition or the sack of the city by a hostile army compel
him to hide his property in two different places? His
goods, once hidden under the earth, were not again drawn
forth, and we received them from him, almost without an
intermediary, sixteen months ago.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>I will say nothing of the rubbish of his own fabrication.
The types are already those of present-day Egypt, and we
could easily swear that most of them were manufactured
for sale to the fellahs, at most, twenty years ago: earrings
in the form of pendants or oblong rings, to the lower part of
which eight or ten metal beads are soldered in bunches;
rings with flat bezels, ornamented or left plain for a name
to be engraved; bracelets formed of a simple reed of
silver foil, thinned at each end and covered with a network
of lozenges fixed by two or three marks hollowed
out by the chisel and lacking elegance, the ends, cut off
straight, nearly meet when the piece is finished, but they
do not join, and so facilitate the putting of the bracelet
on the wrist. It is the honest work of a man who did
not spare his material, but only knew just enough of his
craft to please easily satisfied customers; the taste of the
good people of Bubastis who bought these things was
not of a discriminating sort, or they may have found
their market only in the people’s quarters. There are much
better things of the kind in the Cairo Museum, and if
the new-found treasure had only yielded such objects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
it would have been at once despatched to the <i>salle de vente</i>
for the delight of tourists.</p>

<p>The contrast is striking as soon as we pass to what
comes down from the Pharaonic age. Not that it can be
placed among the best we know in that kind. The age
of Ramses II is already marked by a less sure taste than
that of the ages that preceded it, and I cannot compare it
with the Dahchour objects nor with those of Queen
Ahhotpou. One of the necklaces is the common breastplate
of five rows of little tubes in stone and enamel,
decorated with a fringe of gold egg-shaped ornaments
encrusted with coloured stone. Another necklace, also
of gold, with its eight rows of bottle-shaped pendants
hanging to little chains of tiny beads, would be somewhat
out of keeping with the others if that was its
original form, but the parts had been separated, and we
remounted them ourselves in order to preserve them with
less risk of loss. Five lenticular earrings are formed of two
convex gold pellicles closed at the circumference and joined
by a border of filigree, stamped in the centre with a rosette,
the leaves of which are grouped round a gold or enamel
button; a gold tube soldered to the inside and grooved in
the furrow of a screw passed through the lobe, and was
fastened to an invisible button which, pressed against the
flesh, kept the jewel in its place. There was also a
bracelet in minute particles of metal and enamel, like those
of Ahhotpou and the princesses of Dahchour, but only the
clasp has come down to us, a sliding clasp of a most
primitive character, with no value except for the gold.
The best thing in the series was undoubtedly the pair
of gold and lapis lazuli bracelets on which may be
read the cartouche name Ousimares—Osymandyas—of
Ramses II.</p>

  <div class="caption">ONE OF RAMSES II’S BRACELETS (CLOSED).</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>They form two circular portions of nearly equal size,
joined by two hinges, the first turning on a fixed axis, the
second a movable bolt taken away when the bracelet was
opened. The back part is a mere plate of polished gold
about 1½ inches broad, on which eight twists and eight fillets
are laid side by side. The twists and fillets alternate, and
the ends are bordered with a thin strip parallel to the
hinge. On it are placed two rows of minute particles of
metal soldered together, and kept in place by two flat
double-twisted little chains. The front portion is expanded
to the middle, where it is just over 2 inches in height.
At the hinges it is edged by a row of egg-shaped ornaments
set between two flat chains, and along the curves by a
twist flanked by two fillets. A second frame, included in
the first, is of a more complicated design: a double <i>motif</i> of
little beads and chains goes round the curves, but on the
side of the fixed hinge the cartouche name of Ramses II
is to be seen, and on the side of the movable hinge two
bands of beads and filigree lozenges on a plain background.
In the space thus reserved the goldsmith had traced the
silhouette of a group of ducks lying flat, by means of a line
of beads and a thin thread. The two bodies, which are
packed together so as to be combined in one, are formed
of a piece of lapis lazuli, cut and highly polished. The ends
of the bodies are imprisoned in a gold sheath decorated with
a covering of small knobs and lozenges; the tails are joined
together, and simulate a fan; they are of lapis, striped
with threads of gold to mark the separation of the feathers.
Another gold sheath, of similar workmanship, envelops the
chest; the two necks escape with a bold movement, and the
two heads, twisting round, lie symmetrically on the back
of the creatures. Between them and the frame is a smooth
ribbon in sharp zigzags on a seed-plot of granules. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
whole effect is rather heavy, and it would have been better
if the artist had shown a more sober taste; but having
stated so much, it is clearly seen that his work was conceived
with a perfect understanding of decoration and a mastery
of all the secrets of the art.</p>

<p>All the methods that he so well manipulated may be
found in the work of the goldsmiths of contemporary
Egypt, especially in that of those who, living in remote
villages, have come less under European influence than their
colleagues in the cities. The models they copy are never
of so delicate an imagination or so skilled an execution;
but we note for the most part the same devices and the
same decorative parts of which we note the employment
here; lozenges, zigzags, simple twisted cords, double-plaited
small chains, rounded mallets, threads, filigrees in lines or in
seeds. The ingots are beaten, stretched, fashioned, polished
on the same little anvil. The granules are blown as formerly
in charcoal powder, and the skill with which they are put
together and soldered to obtain the desired designs is as
great as in the time of the Pharaohs. In that, as in
many other industries, the Egypt of to-day has inherited
from the Egypt of the past, and we have only to look at
the artisans in their shops to learn how the subjects of
Ramses II set about their work.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The gold and silver vases are some years later than
the bracelets. On one of them, indeed, may be read the
name of Taouasrît, a great-granddaughter of Ramses II
who married successively Siphtah and Setouî II, and who
enjoyed her hour of celebrity in the last days of the
XIXth Dynasty. It is a half-opened lotus, mounted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
its stem. The calyx of the flower is formed of thin gold-leaf,
not lined, sharply cut at the outer edge. The stalk
is smooth except where the cartouche is engraved: it
expands and flattens out at the bottom to form a foot,
and the widening is decorated with folioles, kept in place
by three circular bands. The lines are sufficiently
harmonious, but the execution is poor, and the object
would scarcely deserve a brief mention in our catalogue
if the royal name did not assign it a definite date: here
the artistic yields to the archæological value.</p>

  <div class="caption">SMALLER OF THE TWO GOLD VASES (FRONT VIEW).</div></div>
</div></div>

<p class="clear">It is otherwise with the gold vases that accompany it.
They are of medium size, and the smallest of them all
measures only about 3 inches from bottom to top; but
the harmony of the proportions makes them perfect
models of the kind of plate that appeared at banquets
on the sideboards or tables of the rich. The bowl is
rounded, and surmounted by a straight neck almost as
high as the bowl itself, the upper edge of which curves
slightly outwards. The front is decorated with a traced
ornament simulating that of one of the large necklaces
in lotus petals with which the Egyptians adorned themselves
on fête-days. The two bands with which it was
fastened to the neck fall undulating on the right and
left, and two cats—the two cats of the goddess worshipped
at Bubastis—look at them inquisitively, with attentive
eye, distended back, quivering tail, straight ears, as if
asking to play with them. A lotus escapes below, and
on the slopes of its corolla two geese glide flapping their
wings. The neck is divided into three equal rows,
separated by flat cords: first a wreath of lotus buds points
downwards, joined together by a band of threads, one
on top of the other; then a row of egg-shaped fruits,
and lastly a band of round florets hollowed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
centre and the hollow encircled with points like
stamens. There is neither handle nor holder, but a
small barrel, through which a gold ring was passed
and by which the object could be hung up, was fastened
by three rivets to the lotus buds on the side opposite
to that of the necklace. The barrel is of bluish faïence
set in a gold mount with a terminal flower. It shows
signs of wear and is dented in several places, but none
of the blows it suffered have seriously injured it: it
is as perfect as at the moment it issued new from the
shop. The choice of motives is elegant, the grouping
irreproachable, the composition bold and a little summary:
the artist seems to have worked quickly, but he
possessed such mastery of his craft that the rapidity
of the fabrication in no way injured the charm of the
work.</p>

<p>The second vase is larger, for it measures about
4½ inches in height; if the shape is similar, the detail
of the decoration is very different. The bottom is flat,
and the outer surface is filled by a lotus, drawn so as
to cover it entirely. The bowl is not smooth, but three-fourths
of it are covered with a regular bossage, which
gives it the appearance of an enormous symbolic ear of
<i>dourah</i>. The method employed to produce it is not
repoussé work properly so-called, hammered from the
inside to the outside. The general network was first
very lightly traced on the metal; then the rounds were
outlined with a blunt instrument and hammered into a
furrow, which, pressing down the metal round them, left
them themselves in relief. The neck was finished by an
almost imperceptible rim, obtained by turning the upper
edge of the gold plaque outwards. There are four
rows instead of the three of the small vase: at the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the line of buds, then lotuses head downwards, with
alternate bunches of grapes or undefined flowers hanging
between them, then centred florets, and then fruits. The
suspensory ring is fastened to the band of petals by a
<i>motif</i> in shape of a calf. The beast lies on its belly, the
tail folded over the back; the head, turning to the right,
is extended and raised, as if to look over the edge of
the neck. It seems to have been chiselled in the solid
metal, and not engrafted, and then finished with the
graver. It is treated broadly, with a sure touch and the
knowledge of animal form that is peculiar to the
Egyptians; it may be placed beside the couchant calves
that serve as perfume caskets and are masterpieces of
sculpture in wood: it will lose nothing by the comparison.
The whole presents the same characteristics as the preceding
vase, and when closely examined we are soon
convinced that it comes from the same workshop; indeed,
there is little risk of mistake if we attribute both to
the same artist.</p>

<p>It is the same with the two silver jugs which accompany
the two gold vases: they have a common origin, and
an equal importance for oriental toreumatology. One of
them, unfortunately, was broken, and we do not possess
all the pieces; but we have enough to be sure that it
resembled the one that has come to us intact. The
bowl is covered to two-thirds of its height with longitudinal
rows of fruits, sitting one on the other like the
scales of a pine cone. Here again it is not ordinary
repoussé work, but the outline of each scale has been
marked round and the metal then pressed down from
outside to inside. The smooth belt which lies between
the embossing and the rise of the neck carries round
the whole of the vase a single line of hieroglyphics expressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
a wish for the eternal life and prosperity of
the royal cupbearer, Toumoumtaouneb, then a vignette
and the owner in worship before a goddess, who is
pacific and Egyptian on the perfect vase, but bellicose
and foreign on the broken vase, armed with lance and
buckler. Toumoumtaouneb was a person of importance
in his time: not only was he entitled chief cupbearer,
but he is proclaimed the king’s messenger in all barbarous
lands, and he doubtless brought back his pious regard for
the bellicose goddess from one of his journeys in Syria.
That is the only exotic element found in the decoration
of the two vases. The top of the neck is ornamented
with a rim of light gold. It has two rows of subjects,
one on top of the other: episodes of hunting or fishing.
A fragment of the broken vase shows a troop of wild
horses running towards a marsh with lotuses, where birds
are flying. The intact vase is unfortunately encrusted in
places with oxide, which obscures the detail of the scenes:
we distinguish outlines of boats, tufts of aquatic plants,
men drawing nets or shooting arrows, beasts at full
gallop; in the upper row there are imaginary trees with
palm-leaves or volutes, among which griffins fight with
lions. If we do not owe the silver vases to the same
artist who fashioned the gold vases, he was at least
endowed with the same admirable skill. He has greatly
simplified the outline of his figures, but the lines are
firm, even, sunk in the metal with the precision of a
master: the craft had no secrets from him. But that is
not the chief merit of his work: twenty others would
have been capable of so much among the goldsmiths
who worked for the king and the great nobles. What
specially distinguishes it is the originality of the design
he chose for the handle, and the manner in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
treated it. A kid, attracted by the fumes of the wine
contained in the vase, had climbed the bowl, and boldly
standing on its hind feet, the legs strained, the spine
rigid, the knees leaning against two gold calyxes which
spring horizontally from the silver face, the muzzle
pressed against the moulding, he looks greedily over the
edge: a ring passing through the nostril serves for hanging
up the vase. The body is hollow and has been fashioned
in two pieces stamped out, and the two halves soldered
together longitudinally and touched up with the graver.
The horns and ears are inserted: a triangular hole was
introduced in the middle of the forehead. The material
technique is excellent, but the conception is even superior
to the technique: nothing could be truer than the movement
that inspires the little creature, nor more ingenious
than the expression of greediness emanating from the
whole of the body.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE VASE WITH THE KID.</p>

<p>(About 6¼ inches in height.)</p></div></div>

<p>Representations of many similar vases may be seen
on the monuments of the Theban Dynasties, with foxes,
leopards, and human beings for handles, and we had
asked ourselves if they really existed anywhere except in
the imagination of the painters of the hypogeums. There
is now no manner of doubt that they were faithful reproductions
of models used by the Egyptians, or by the
nations with whom the Egyptians had relations either in
war or in commerce. Shall we ever find one of the large
table épergnes which show scenes of conquest, with trees,
animals, statuettes of negroes or Asiatics in gold or in
enamel? They contained such a large amount of metal
that they would have been cast into the melting-pot at
some moment of want, but we await the chance that
may give us depôts similar to that of Zagazig: I do not
think, however, that we shall find pieces of a finer inspiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
or of a more harmonious composition than that of
the vase with the kid.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The silver pateræ have suffered much. Hurriedly piled
up in the receptacle where they were hidden, the oxide
bound them solidly together, and we have not yet succeeded
in separating them all. It has besides eaten into
them in so thorough a fashion that we have only ventured
to clean two or three: it is doubtful if we shall
ever risk touching the rest. It is a misfortune common to
most of the silver objects found in Egypt: under the
influence of the annual infiltrations, the organic acids, of
which the subsoil of the ancient cities is composed, attack
them and eat them away without truce or mercy. If
the metal was of suitable thickness we might hope that the
surface only was injured and the core of the metal unharmed,
but most often they consist of a leaf of metal
of extreme thinness, which quickly decomposes. Thus
the object only endures at all thanks to the oxide crust,
and if that support was removed it would be resolved into
dust and tiny fragments.</p>

  <div class="caption">SILVER STRAINER.</div></div>

<p>Only one of the pateræ is almost intact. It measures
just over 6 inches in diameter and about 5½ inches in height.
It is flat at the bottom and the sides are slightly inflated
at the base; they are decorated at the top with a gold
border fastened to the rim by rivets. Two small decorated
plates in chased gold are furnished with rings which hold
a little gold rod that, bent in three, serves to suspend it.
Four large gold rounds are placed flat on the rim opposite
the handle. The side is smooth, with a single line of
hieroglyphics on the outside—a kind wish, on the parvis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
of the temple of Neîth, for the owner, the singing-girl
of Neîth, Tamaî, “the Cat.” It is silver leaf,
stamped out in a curve, the two ends of which have
been joined without any appreciable overlapping and then
soldered together. The bottom is also formed of silver
leaf, which is fastened to the lower edge of the sides
and divided into two concentric rows. In the centre is
a sort of umbilicus, with a gold flat-rimmed hat decorated
by a line of rounded beads of metal and several lines of
little chains. The row nearest the centre is slightly
lower; on it may be seen water full of fish, with tufts
of lotus here and there. A little papyrus boat, occupied
by a naked shepherd and a calf, floats amid the
patches of green; birds fly about, and two nude figures
of young women—the same who, modelled in wood,
provided the sculptors of the period with a charming
design for perfume ladles—swim side by side in order to
gather flowers. A flat space and a line of tiny rounds
separate the pool from a hunting-ground that four conventional
palm-trees planted at equal distance divide into
the same number of distinct compartments. Two winged
sphinxes with women’s heads stand on either side of one
palm, the paw raised and stretched out as if to pull down
the dates: two symmetrical pairs of goats leap at the
other palms to browse on them. Between these groups,
animals run madly about, a wild ox chased by a leopard,
hares and gazelles by foxes, dogs, or wolves. The figures
of the middle row are of repoussé work of so feeble a
character that we should almost say they are engraved
on the metal: those of the outer row are of a stronger
repoussé, and then gone over again and finished with the
graver.</p>

<p>The other pateræ resemble these as far as the technique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
and decoration are concerned: they evidently came from
the same workshop and belonged to one owner. Were
they for daily use or only for ornament? It would seem
that they were not fashioned for a definite use: at least
they do not recall the shapes seen on the monuments in
the hands of guests at a banquet or of priests in the
sacrifices. They were hung on the walls of halls, or placed
on sideboards on fête-days, and if they were given to the
guests, it was not simply for them to eat or drink out
of. Filled with fresh water or clear wine, it was a sort
of miniature lake, in the centre of which the point of
the gold hat rose like an islet: the landscape and figures,
seen through the transparent medium, stood out on the
flat background with peculiar vivacity, and were effaced
or deformed at pleasure when the liquid was disturbed.
It is not so long since we were pleased with similar
puerilities, and Orientals do not disdain them to-day:
the pateræ were, perhaps, toys rather than objects of real
utility. I shall not say the same of the silver strainers,
the forms of which are elegant but not overladen with
ornament, and evidently intended for use. A wide opened
funnel, a plaque at the bottom pierced with tiny little
holes—the handle alone testifies to any artistic attempt—an
open papyrus flower, the petals of which, bent over the
stem, lean on the rim of the funnel. It is a useful implement
for kitchen or cellar, well adapted to its end,
easy to keep clean, in a word practical, a thing in truth
that the pateræ are not.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is clear, then, that the interest of the find is great
in itself on account of the number and beauty of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
objects. Until now the greater part of the goldsmiths’
work we possess was of the Ptolemaic period, and those
that could be attributed with certainty to the Pharaonic
period possessed no characteristics that permitted us to
judge the skill of the Egyptians. The pictures on the
walls of tombs or temples authorize our belief that it was
very skilful, but the conventions of their designs are still
so ill-defined that there is not always agreement about
their interpretation. It is even necessary to ask if certain
motives figuring outside a vase ought not to be taken
as belonging to the decoration of the inside. We now
have a sufficient number of their works to justify our conjecture,
and to declare in all sincerity that the goldsmiths
were in no way inferior to the sculptors, at least so long as
the second Theban Empire lasted.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE ZAGAZIG SILVER PATERÆ.</div></div>

<p>These objects were found on the site of ancient
Bubastis, and the presence of the cats of the goddess
Bastît on several of them, as well as the name of Tamaî,
the Cat, that is on the chief vase, seem to point that they
were made in the place that has restored them to us.
It is true that Tamaî was a singing-girl of Neîth, living
in the enclosed space before the temple of Neîth, and
that might be a counter-indication, at least so far as these
objects are concerned. Setting aside the question of
origin, which is too uncertain, we may ask if they are
really Egyptian by inspiration, or if there is not a risk
in examining them more closely of the discovery of proofs
of some foreign influence. For about a quarter of a
century, now, Assyria, Chaldæa, Asia Minor, Crete and
the Egyptian islands have become better known to us,
and the scholars who have studied those places have not
been slow to despoil Egypt in their favour: it is too
often sufficient for an object or an artistic design frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
occurring on Egyptian monuments to be found in those
places at once to attribute to them the original invention
or ownership. I cannot help thinking that many of these
claims are not legitimate, and that in a more general way
it is exceedingly rash in the case of a civilization so complex
and distant in its beginnings as that of Egypt at the
time of the second Theban Empire, to claim the ability to
discern all the elements it borrowed from outside. We
know how rapidly the peoples of the Nile assimilate the
foreigner: in ancient times, it was with the arts as with men,
and forms of architecture, of drawing, of industrial production,
transplanted among them, either quickly disappeared
and left no trace, or yielded to the conditions of the
country, and became so completely fused with the taste of
its environment that it is now scarcely possible to distinguish
the foreign from the native. I believe that Egypt
certainly accepted exotic types; but the lands with
which she had relations did not abstain from imitating
her, and from the most distant ages. She gave to others
at least as much as she received from them, and in many
cases where the question of filiation has recently been
determined against her, it would be well to suspend that
judgment, if not to upset it.</p>

<p>In this case, I imagine that it will not enter any one’s
mind to dispute that the bracelets of Ramses II and
the chalice of Taouasrît are Egyptian pure and simple.
The two gold vases and the two silver jugs present no
foreign characteristic: the gold kid is of the same family
as the goats sculptured fifteen or twenty centuries earlier
in the Memphian bas-reliefs, standing on their hind legs
and nibbling at a bush. The pateræ, it is true, resemble
the Phœnician gold and bronze cups so often found in
the Euphrates districts and in the lands on the shores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of the Mediterranean: but no one has refused to admit
that they were imitations of Egyptian models, and
perhaps a more impartial examination would lead
archæologists to restore some of them at least to Egypt.
At any rate, the treasure of Zagazig shows us what
those models ought to be: the Phœnicians were not unmindful
of them and respected the general arrangement,
even if they often modified the detail. One element only
in the scenes of the two rows may be exotic: the female
sphinx with the strange locks of hair, if we choose to
see in her a derivative of the griffin rather than a
fantastic deformation of the male sphinx of a former age.
But even so, it must not be forgotten that the griffin
belongs to the ancient national foundations like the oxen
and gazelles, goats, dogs, leopards seen by its side: its
presence would only prove—if its form was so characteristic
that we could not refuse to believe it an incongruity—that
it was borrowed from the arts of Syria or Chaldæa by
some artist tired of always using the traditional types of
his country.</p>

<span class="subhead">THREE STATUETTES IN WOOD<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>The Louvre</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> three little wooden figures reproduced here are of
Theban origin, and represent persons who lived under the
conqueror-kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties.</p>

<p>The first was found in the Salt collection, purchased by
Champollion at Leghorn in 1825, which forms the basis
of the Louvre collection.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> It is a young woman in a long
clinging dress trimmed with a band of embroidery in
white thread running from top to bottom. She wears a
gold necklace of three rows and gold bracelets. On her
head is a wig, the hair of which hangs down to the rise
of the breast; the wig is kept in place by a large gilded
band simulating a crown of leaves arranged points downwards.
The right arm hangs down beside the body, and
the hand held an object, probably in metal, which has
disappeared; the left arm is folded across the chest, and
the hand clasps the stem of a lotus, the bud pointing
between the breasts. The body is supple and well-formed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the breast young, straight, slight, the face broad, and
smiling with something of softness and vulgarity. The
artist was unable to avoid heaviness in the arrangement of
the coiffure, but he has modelled the body with an elegant
and chaste delicacy; the dress follows the form without
revealing it indiscreetly, and the gesture with which the
young woman presses the flower against her is natural.
The statuette is painted dark red, except the eyes and the
embroidery, which are white, and the wig, which is black:
the bracelets, the necklace, and the bandeau are of a yellow
gold identical with the small book exhibited in the glass
case marked Z in the “Salle civile.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

  <p>The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>Two inscriptions engraved on the pedestal, and then
painted yellow, inform us of the name of the woman, and
of that of the individual who dedicated the statue. One
on the front runs thus:</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
(A) <span class="smcap">Adoration to Phtah<br />
Sokar-Osiri,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> great God, Prince<br />
of Eternity, to whom are given all kinds of good<br />
things and pure things, to the double of the<br />
perfect lady Naî of the true perfect voice.</span>
</p>

<p>The other is engraved on the right side, and runs:</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
(B) <span class="smcap">It is her Brother who makes her name to live,<br />
the servant Phtah-Maî.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>From other monuments we know more than one
Egyptian of the name Phtah-Maî, and more than one
lady Naî: but none of them has any claim to be identified
with our two personages. Phtah-Maî is not a noble: he
filled a very humble post, that of a page attached to a
noble, or a subordinate employé of a temple or of
a court of justice. But the charm of the monument he
devoted to the memory of his sister is only the more
remarkable.</p>

<p>The personage in the middle is a priest, standing,
wearing the short wig with little locks of hair in rows
one above the other. The bust is bare, and his only
garment is a long skirt falling half way down the leg,
spread out in front into a sort of pleated apron. In his
two hands he bears a sacred insignia consisting of a ram’s
head surmounted by the solar disk, and forming an ægis,
the whole set into a staff of fairly large dimensions: the
attitude is one of repose. The third figure, on the contrary,
is full of movement and activity. It is an officer
in semi-military costume of the time of Amenôphis III
or of his successors: a small wig, a clinging smock with
sleeves, a short loin-cloth tightly girded over the hips and
scarcely descending to the middle of the thigh, decorated
in front with a small piece of stuff standing out, pleated
lengthwise. These two statuettes are painted dark red
with the exception of the wig, which is black, of the cornea
of the eyes, which is white, and the insignia of the priest,
which is yellow. The old pedestal has disappeared, and
with it the name. Like the limestone and wooden statues
of large dimensions, these formed part of the funerary
equipment: they were the supports of souls in miniature,
and served as a body for the double of the model and
<i>kept alive the name</i> of a person who had been loved or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
well known. There are a large number of them in the
museums, and nearly all are of the same epoch. Neither
the Ancient nor the Middle Empire made them—Saïte art
preferred hard stone: the wooden statuettes that I have
so far seen are of the second Theban period, and belong
to the XVIIIth, XIXth, and XXth Dynasties.</p>

<p>Some of them, if not all, were used for purposes that
seem strange to us. Several had little rolls of papyrus
fastened to their pedestal or their body, ordinary letters
that the writers sent to one another; one possessed by the
Leyden Museum is an adjuration addressed <i>to the perfect
soul of the lady Ankhari</i> by her still living husband:<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
“What fault have I committed against thee that I should
be reduced to the miserable condition in which I find
myself? What have I done to justify this attack on me,
if no fault has been committed against thee? From the
time I became thy husband until this day, what have I done
against thee that I should conceal? What shall I do when
I have to bear witness to my conduct in regard to thee,
and shall appear with thee before the tribunal of the
dead, addressing myself to the cycle of the infernal gods,
and thou wilt be judged after this writing, which is in
words uttering my complaint in regard to what thou
hast done. What wilt thou do?” The general tone of the
piece is, as is clear, one of complaint and accusation. The
husband laments about “the miserable condition to which
he is reduced,” three years after he has become a widower;
then he relates the incidents of his conjugal life in order
to show the ingratitude he has received for his trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
and care. “When thou becamest my wife, I was young,
I was with thee, I did not desert thee, I caused no grief
to thy heart. Now so I acted when I was young; when
I was promoted to high dignities by Pharaoh, I did not
desert thee; I said: ‘Let them be mutual between us!’
and as everybody who came saw me with thee, thou didst
not receive those whom thou didst not know, for I acted
according to thy will. Now, here it is, thou hast not satisfied
my heart and I shall plead with thee, and the true
will be distinguished from the false.” He dwells on and
reminds her of his kindnesses: “I have never been found
acting brutally to thee like a peasant who enters other
people’s houses.” When she died, during an eight months’
absence occasioned by his service with Pharaoh, “I did
what was seeming for thee: I lamented thee greatly with
my people opposite my dwelling, I gave stuffs and swathings
for thy burial, and for that purpose had many
linen cloths woven, and I omitted no good offering I
could make thee.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> The poor man does not state clearly
the nature of the troubles from which he suffered. Perhaps
he imagined that his wife tormented him in the
form of a spectre; perhaps, what after all comes to the
same thing in the belief of an Egyptian, he was attacked
by diseases and overwhelmed with infirmities that he
attributed to the malignity of the dead woman. We are
reminded of the strange actions that the Icelanders of the
Middle Ages practised against ghosts. The administration
set on foot the whole cortège of officials and the whole of its
legal code to bring the accusation, judge and condemn the
dead who persisted in haunting the house in which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
had lived. The records of the causes are extant and
testify to the gravity that presided over this strange procedure.
The Leyden papyrus certainly relates to an affair
of the kind. A husband, addressing his wife’s soul,
summons her to suspend persecutions that are in no way
justified, under pain of answering for her conduct before
the infernal jury. If she did not heed this preliminary
advice, the matter would be brought later before the
tribunal of the gods of the west and pleaded: the papyrus
would serve as a piece of convincing evidence, and then
“the true would be distinguished from the false.”</p>

<p>There was one difficulty to be overcome: how was
the summons to be sent to her? The Egyptians were
never embarrassed when it was a question of communicating
with the other world. The husband read the letter
in the tomb, then fastened it to a figure of the woman.
Thus she could not fail to receive the adjuration as she
received the funerary banquet, or the effect of the prayers
that assured her happiness beyond the tomb. The preoccupations
of art held only a subordinate place in statues
like those of the lady Naî and her two companions: the
religious idea was predominant, and it was religion which
gave the monument its meaning.</p>

<span class="subhead">A FRAGMENT OF A THEBAN STATUETTE<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor smaller">82</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> excavations undertaken by Mr. Mond on the eastern
slope of the hills of Cheîkh-Abd-el-Gournah, in one of the
richest of the Theban cemeteries of the XVIIIth and XIXth
Dynasties, have already given several valuable monuments
to the “Service des Antiquités”; and nothing surpasses or
even equals the fragment illustrated here. The statuette
to which it belongs was broken in the middle. The hips
and legs have disappeared, as well as the right arm,
and the plinth against which the back leaned; Mr. Mond
eagerly sought the missing pieces among the residue of his
find, but in vain; they were not forthcoming, and were
doubtless either destroyed in ancient times, or carried
off by some amateur during the nineteenth century.
The fragment that remains to us measures nearly a foot
in length and about 4½ inches across the shoulders; there
is nothing in the lines by which one can determine
whether the person it represents was seated or standing.
I am inclined to think that, according to the custom
of the time, the attitude resembled that of the little
lady Touî in the Louvre,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> standing, the feet nearly on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the same level, the right arm hanging down, the head
erect, with the wig of ceremony, and the dress of great
holidays.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE MOND STATUETTE (FRONT VIEW).</div></div>

<p>The material employed by the sculptor is limestone of
the kind the inscriptions describe as the <i>fine white stone of
Tourah</i>, but thick beds of it extend along the sides of
the valley of Egypt from the environs of Cairo to the
defiles of Gebeleîn. It abounds in the Theban plain, and
although it is too split and cracked in every sense to be
of any use for building purposes, it is admirably suited
for designs of restricted dimensions, such as those of our
statuette. It was most probably carved in the stone
of Cheîkh-Abd-el-Gournah itself, perhaps in one of the
blocks extracted at the time of hollowing out the tomb
for which it was destined. It forms an excellent substance,
supple and firm at the same time, and subserves with an
inimitable docility the boldest and the most delicate strokes
of the chisel; the grain of marble, crystalline and almost
metallic, makes the sensation on the eye of a rigid
envelope in which the subject is, as it were, imprisoned,
while limestone, softer and richer, better reproduces the
elasticity of the surface of flesh and the free play of
the muscles under the skin. Our statuette had been
illuminated in accordance with custom, but it bears only
imperceptible traces of painting and has the natural colour
of old limestone, a tone between cream and yellowed
ivory, which recalls the paleness of Egyptian women. The
detail of the clothing and ornaments which was due to
the brush has vanished, and is only indicated on the border
of the mantle by faint tooling. It has thus lost its archæological
value, but has gained an aspect of refinement
wanting in works where the colour has been preserved
intact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>The young woman who has thus left us her portrait
lived under the XIXth Dynasty, at a time when fashion
imposed enormous head-dresses and scanty clothing on its
votaries. An almost transparent linen covers the left
shoulder, then crosses the chest and is knotted under the
right armpit, concealing the rest of the costume; the
left hand is freed from it and clasps a lotus stem, the flower
reaching to the hollow between the breasts. The bust
has not yet attained its plenitude, but the breasts are
well shaped and well separated, but so slight that they
scarcely make any impression on the linen; the lines of
the arm, shoulder, and neck indicate thinness. The artist
has well understood the characteristics of the dawn of
womanhood, and the discreet fashion in which he permits
us to guess the slender grace beneath the garment is that
of a master craftsman, but it is in the head and face that
he shows the full measure of his talent. The head is fitted
into a wig of complicated structure which yields nothing
in size to the majestic peruke of Louis XIV. A double
ribbon running from the forehead to the back of the neck
divides the hair into two equal masses, which are themselves
divided into volutes of little waved locks, each
formed of two thin tresses, twisted together at the extremity.
The whole forms a stiff heavy fabric which,
unskilfully interpreted, would make the piece ugly, no
matter how successful in the other parts. Our sculptor
has made no change in the general arrangement—his
model would not have permitted it—but he has adjusted
the parts with such happy ingenuity that the monster wig,
instead of overpowering the face, acts as a frame to it
and sets it off.</p>

  <img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="2055" height="2967" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE MONO STATUETTE (PROFILE).</div></div>

<p>It is of the purest Egyptian type, not the heavy,
brutal type which predominates in the Memphian age and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
among the fellahs to-day, but an elegant refined type
of which numerous examples are provided by statuettes
of all periods. The forehead appears to be rather low,
but we cannot be sure if it was so by nature, or if it is
the wig which conceals its height. The eyes are long,
almond-shaped, slanting towards the temple, widely
opened. The eyelids are drawn clearly, almost sharply,
and meet at an acute angle both at the inner corner
and at the outer commissure. The globe of the eye is
rather prominent, the pupil was added with the brush,
and a sort of greyish tone vaguely marks the place.
The eyebrows are a flattened bow, thin and regular.
The nose is attached to the superciliary arcade by a fairly
accentuated curve; it is straight, thin, rounded at the
end, with delicate nostrils. The lower part of the face
is thick-set, and of so firm a cut that with age—if age
ever came—it would have become hard. The lips are
full, thick, edged the whole length, split in the middle:
they are pressed together as if to keep back a smile.
The whole face changes in character and almost in
century, according to the angle from which it is looked
at. Seen from the front it is round and full, with neither
superabundance nor softness of flesh: it is the little middle-class
girl of Thebes, pretty, but common in form and
expression. Seen from the side between the hanging
pieces of the wig, as if between two long ringlets falling
on the shoulders, it assumes a malicious, roguish expression
not ordinarily usual in Egyptian women: it might be
one of our contemporaries who from caprice or coquetry
had put on the ancient coiffure.</p>

<p>Who was she in her lifetime, and what was her name?
The fragment which represents her was found at the
bottom of a funerary pit, in the court-yard of the tomb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
of Menna, and Menna flourished under the XIXth
Dynasty. Was she one of his wives, or daughters, or
sisters? The inscription which might have told us is
heaven knows where, and it will be a great piece of
good fortune if it is ever found.</p>

INDUSTRIAL SCULPTURE IN WOOD<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor smaller">84</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> little lady Touî, who entered the Louvre last year,
was in her lifetime a singer in the service of Amon.
The title gives rise to doubt and scarcely permits us to
determine to what class of society she belonged. The
singers in the service of Amon were of all ranks, some
married, others free. They were all bound to serve the
god; they shook before him the sistrum that kept off
spirits, or wielded the magic whip, the <i>monaît</i>, with which
they beat the air to keep off with heavy blows the evil
beings who floated invisible in it. The most humble were
of easy morals, and the series of licentious vignettes in
the Turin Museum leaves no room for doubt regarding
the kind of life they led. They were the servants of the
temple; they placed their bodies at the free disposal of
their master Amon, and whoever addressed them in his
name would not meet with refusal. In the Græco-Roman
period the high-priest chose a young girl of rare beauty
from among the richest and noblest families of Thebes
and solemnly dedicated her. She became the chief singer,
and shared the life of her companions of lower origin as
long as youth lasted; when she was past the age of child-bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
she retired, and an honourable marriage allowed
her to end her days amid the respect of all. The lady
Touî’s position seems to have been less curious. The
wives of priests or those of citizens affiliated to the different
brotherhoods of Amon formed associations of
<i>singers</i> who appeared in the temples on days of festival
or at the hours fixed for certain ceremonies: they only
accepted the duty of playing the sistrum or of plying
the whip, leaving to the others the rest of the function.
Touî doubtless had a husband and children somewhere in
Thebes. In an Egyptian tale<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> the heroine, Tboubouî,
daughter of a priest of Bastît, replies to the lover who is
importuning her: “I am pure, I am no wanton.” Touî
might say the same to us if, trusting to her title, we
confused her with the common <i>singing-girls</i>, who yielded
their bodies to all.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE LADY TOUÎ, STATUETTE IN WOOD.</p>

<p>The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>The statuette that represents her may deservedly rank
as one of the best works which have recently emerged
from Theban soil. She stands upright in the hieratical
attitude of repose, one foot in advance, the head fixed,
the right arm hanging by her side, the left arm across
the chest, holding the sacred whip, the <i>monaît</i>, folded up.
She wears the ceremonial costume, a long robe with
sleeves, narrow, crossed in front, edged with a heavy, stiff
fringe, a broad necklace round the neck; on her head the
immense wig fashionable among the Thebans in the
eleventh and tenth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, numerous little tresses
gathered together at the ends into two or three, and
finished off with tassels or little curls. The effect was
fairly ugly: it lent heaviness to the top of the figure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
diminished the size of the face, cramped the neck, concealed
the fall of the shoulders and the rise of the breasts,
broke the equilibrium of the body. But the anonymous
artist who made the portrait of the lady Touî has derived
an almost fortunate advantage from this deplorable head-dress:
he has treated it as a sort of background which
sets off the face, neck, and chest. The lateral tufts of
hair frame the features without making them too heavy,
and the close-fitting coif at the top is placed on the skull
without appearing to crush it. The slender, healthy forms
of the body are rendered in remarkable fashion, and the
modelling of the belly and legs shows itself under the
clinging stuff with a precision that is in no way brutal.
In looking at it we certainly recognize more than one
defect: the figure lacks suppleness and the face expression;
the wood is cut harshly and with an almost puerile
detail. The whole, however, pleases by some indescribable
simple and chaste charm: the Louvre was perfectly right
to acquire it, even if more money was expended than is
usual on Egyptian objects of such small size.</p>

<p>Its use is easy to determine; it is a miniature <i>statue
of the double</i> shut up in the tombs of the Memphian
period. A statue was not within the reach of everybody:
only the rich could procure one, and people of moderate
means were obliged to content themselves with little
figures of less cost. The population of priests, <i>servants</i>,
<i>singing-girls</i>, heads of the works who lived round the
sanctuary of Amon or in the temples of the necropolis,
had many pretensions to luxury with slender resources:
their tombs are filled with objects which pretend to be
what they are not, and veritably deceive the eye, destined
to give the dead the illusion of opulence; massive wooden
vases painted to represent alabaster or granite vases, rings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
and jewels in glass or enamel that appear to be gold
rings and jewels, furniture in common wood, varnished,
speckled, veined, to simulate furniture in rare woods.
The lady Touî belonged to that half-needy class, and had
to substitute statuettes of carved and polished wood for
limestone or sandstone statues. All the museums in
Europe have similar ones, and through Champollion, the
Louvre possessed the lady Naî,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> who sustains comparison
very well with her new comrade. Egyptian sculptors
had acquired veritable mastery in this subordinate form
of sculpture, and there are pieces of singular charm
among those that have reached us. Take, for instance,
the little girl and the woman I have chosen almost at
hazard in one of the cases of the Turin Museum. The
little girl is standing, one foot in advance, the arms
hanging down, naked according to the custom of
Egyptian children, with a necklace, and a belt which
loosely surrounds the loins, short plaited hair with a
tress falling over the ears. The material is less precious
than with the lady Touî, and the work less thorough,
but has the slim delicacy of a little Egyptian girl of
eight or ten years old ever been better expressed? It
is an exact portrait, in costume and figure, of the little
Nubian girls of the Cataract before the age of puberty
obliges them to wear clothes; it is their thin chest,
slender hips, clearly cut, delicate thigh, their bearing,
hesitating and bold at the same time, the roguish expression
of their features.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="clear">The other statuette represents a well-developed woman
standing on a round pedestal without a scrap of clothing
or veil, but very proud of her head-dress, and especially of
her big earrings. She touches the right one with her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and makes it stand out a little in order to show it, or
to assure herself that the jewel is very becoming; the
head is big, the shoulders thin, the chest narrow, and the
sculptor was embarrassed to render the movement of the
arms; but the eyes are so wide open, the smile so contented,
the expression of the whole so intelligent, that
we can easily excuse that defect.</p>

<p>Men were as well treated as women by this art fostered
by persons of small means. Scribes of subordinate
rank, old retired officers, retail merchants, or men at the
head of small industrial concerns, all of whom swarmed
in the poorer quarters, felt as strongly as their wives, in
default of the stone statue, the need of acquiring a
wooden image which would show what they had been
like in their lifetime. There were as many artists as
they wished to model them in the attitude they preferred,
in their everyday costume or in that of fête-days, bearing
and likeness guaranteed. Those found in the tombs in
the early years of the nineteenth century form a veritable
gallery, most varied and curious, of the different types
prevailing from the thirteenth to the ninth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
in Thebes and its environs among the lower middle-class.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
Some had been soldiers, and wear the light petticoat
bulging at the waist of the Egyptian foot-soldier;
others had spent their lives scribbling in a Government
office; the greater number belonged to one of the
funerary professions, guardians of mummies, decorators
of hypogeums, hewers of tombs, sacristans or priests of
a low order employed in the minor offices of burials
or commemorative rites. They proudly exhibit their
insignia: they carry long staves crowned with sacred
emblems—the human head of Hathor, the hawk’s beak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of Horus—and everything in their attitude betrays the
pride and satisfaction of knowing themselves so fine and
so important. Their bearing reveals what the inscriptions
usually placed on the pedestal of their statuettes confirm:
“It is I, Khâbokhni, the Servant of the ‘True’ Place,”
he who poured the libations, or who, at the canonical
hours, distributed a portion of bread, flowers, and fruits to
each of the dead entrusted to his care. The Egyptians
were admirable in observation and full of satirical
humour: I would not swear that, in impressing this
character of naïve vanity on their works, the sculptors
were not yielding to the temptation of discreetly amusing
themselves at the expense of their sitters.</p>

<p>Study of these small monuments is too much neglected.
By considering the colossi of granite or sandstone,
the heroic statues and the ceremonial groups, we are
inclined to recognize only qualities of grandeur and immobile
majesty in Egyptian art; the wooden statuettes
show how, on occasion, it could display charm and wit.
Most of them are the products of chance, commercial
pieces, prepared in advance for the needs of customers,
of which a large assortment was always kept in reserve.
The family desiring to offer one to one of its dead came
to get it at the fairest price, and something was sold,
more or less well done according to the sum that was
spent; the choice being made, the piece was adapted
to its definitive destination by engraving on the pedestal,
or on the back, the names which transformed the
anonymous doll into a body for the double of a particular
individual. They were artisans who sculptured
these images, or rather manufactured them for the undertakers
of funerals. Their education was so complete and
their hand so practised that they rarely fell very low;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
their average productions are of honest composition and
sufficiently true in feeling. When they were given
enough time or commissioned to take great care with a
piece of work, those who combined natural talent with
the routine of their craft produced work of real value—the
statuettes of the lady Touî, of the little girl and the
woman in the Turin Museum, and many others hidden
from the public in the cupboards of our museums.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME PERFUME LADLES OF THE <span class="smcap">XVIIIth</span> DYNASTY<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>The Louvre</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> is not without reason that these objects are called
perfume ladles. The Egyptians used them, in fact, for
making either essences, pomades, or the various coloured
pigments with which both men and women painted
the cheeks, lips, eyelids and underneath the eyes, the
nails and palms of the hand. The form and decoration
vary in accordance with the epochs. At the time
of the Ramessides, between the fourteenth and twelfth
centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, fashion introduced Syrian manufactures
into Egypt; later, under the Bubastis and under the
Ethiopian kings of the XXVth Dynasty, some Chaldæan
or Ninevite manufactures came in. The five ladles
illustrated here are purely Egyptian in origin and
style. The designs were generally borrowed from the
fauna and flora of the valley. The first has by way
of handle a young girl lost among the lotuses, who is
gathering a bud; a tuft of stems from which two full-blown
flowers escape attach the handle to the bowl, the
oval of which has its rounded part outside and the point
inside. In the second, the young girl is framed by two
stems of lotus flowers and papyrus, and walks along playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
a long-handled guitar. The next ladle substitutes a
bearer of offerings for the musician, and the fourth has
the musician standing on a boat sailing among the reeds.
The last takes the form of a slave, half bent under an
enormous sack. Nothing could be better than the
general design of the decoration. The artisans brought
as much conscience and skill to its execution as the
sculptors gave to their colossal statues. The physiognomy
and age of the four young girls are well characterized.
The girl who plucks the lotuses is an <i>ingénue</i>:
that state is shown by her carefully plaited hair and her
pleated skirt. Theban ladies wore long skirts, and this
is only turned up high to facilitate walking among
the reeds without soiling its edges. The two musicians,
on the contrary, belong to the lower class; one
has only a belt round her hips, the other a short petticoat,
carelessly fastened. The bearer of offerings has
the tress of hair falling over the ear, as was the custom
with children, and her belt is her sole garment. She is
one of the slender, slim young girls of whom many may
be seen among the fellahs on the banks of the Nile,
and her nudity does not prevent her from belonging to
a respectable family: children of both sexes only began
to wear clothes at the age of puberty. Lastly, the slave,
with his thick lips, flattened nose, bestial jaw, low
forehead, sugar-loaf head, is evidently a caricature of a
foreign prisoner; the brutish, conscientious way in
which he lifts his heavy burden, the angular prominences
of the body, the type of the head, the arrangement
of the different parts, remind us of the general
aspect of some terra-cotta grotesques that come from
Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="clear">All the details of nature grouped round and framing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the principal subject, the exact form of the flowers and
leaves, the species of the birds, are very accurate, and
sometimes betray wit. Of the three ducks that the bearer
of offerings has tied by their claws, and which hang over
her arm, two are resigned to their fate and go swinging
along, the neck stretched out, the eye wide open; the third
lifts its head up and flutters its wings. The two water-fowl
perched on the lotuses listen at ease, the beaks on
their crops, to the lute-player who is passing near them;
experience has taught them that they need not disturb
themselves for songs, and that a young girl is only to be
feared if she is armed. In the bas-reliefs, the sight of a bow
or a boomerang throws them into confusion, just as to-day
that of a gun scatters the crows. The Egyptians knew
the habits of the animals who lived in their land, and
took pleasure in minutely observing them. Observation
became instinctive with them, and they gave a striking
air of reality to the least of their productions.</p>

<p>The bowl of the ladles is generally oval. It is edged
by a running decoration between two lines, a waving line,
or a more or less accentuated denticulation. The cavity
made in the slave’s burden is of irregular shape, and the
thick border is decorated with lightly carved flowers and
foliage. It was a perfume box rather than a ladle, for the
little hole in the lower part, near the prisoner’s shoulder,
held the hinge of the lid, now lost. The fifth ladle is in
the shape of a quadrangular trough. The bottom, set in
four rectangular mouldings, is covered with waving lines
simulating water; the edges represent the banks of the
lake and are covered with aquatic scenes. On the right,
amid the flowers and lotus buds, a little personage is
catching birds with a net; on the left, another is fishing
from a boat. They are both summarily indicated, but are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
not the less full of life. It is a miniature reproduction on
a wooden ladle of the great scenes of fishing and bird-catching
which are painted in the tombs and the temples.</p>

<p>The objects are in wonderful preservation. A lid is
lost, a lotus branch is broken behind the girl who is
gathering flowers, one of the feet of the bearer of offerings
is missing. Otherwise they are intact, and might have just
come from the hands of the craftsman. The wood is of
a very fine grain, marvellously adapted to the needs of
the chisel. It has never been painted, but has become
darkened with time. The original colour must have been
the golden yellow seen in the cracks of some pieces of
thin wood found in the tombs. None of the ladles show
any signs of wear: they seem to have been deposited new
in the tomb near the dead person, who preserved them
new until our day. Like the rest of the funerary equipment,
they were intended for use in the other world. The
lists of offerings mention antimony powder and green
paint among the things sent to the <i>double</i> on festival days:
the perfume ladles and boxes were as necessary in the
tomb as they had been on earth.</p>

<p>I do not think that any survive which we can with certainty
attribute to the time of the Pyramids: but the
bas-reliefs of the Memphian tombs show us the joiners at
work, and do not allow us to doubt that the trade in
small wooden objects was very flourishing at that period.
Under the great Theban Dynasties, Egypt exported them
by thousands; imitated in Phœnicia, or even transported
directly by the Phœnicians to the Mediterranean coasts,
they transmitted the forms of Oriental art to the West.
It is probable that Theban production—the only one
known to us by dated monuments found in the tombs—entirely
ceased, or at least became almost insignificant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
when the greatness of Thebes declined from the tenth
century <i>B.C.</i> They were still manufactured at Memphis
and in the important cities of the Delta until the Ptolemies
and the Cæsars. Recent specimens are somewhat rare, and
present considerable differences from those of Theban
manufacture. As it was exactly this Memphian art that
almost exclusively supplied the Phœnician market from
the time of Sheshonq, it is vexing that examples are not
more abundant: as we do not possess sufficient, we cannot
accurately judge what their influence was on the arts of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The five objects I have been discussing come from the
Salt collection. The Theban tombs where they were
found were exploited and emptied at the beginning of the
nineteenth century by collectors and dealers; it is difficult
to find any like them in Egypt now, and those that are
discovered are very inferior to these in delicacy and
quality.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME GREEN BASALT STATUETTES OF THE SAÏTE
PERIOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">These</span> statuettes were cut in greenish basalt of fine
grain, loved by the artists of the New Empire and the
Saïte Period above all other stones. They formed part
of the Salt collection, and are now exhibited in the
Louvre.</p>

<p>The first represents a Pharaoh, as is proved by the
serpent that rises above his forehead and the hawk’s head
that terminates the dagger passed through his belt. He
is standing, and walking quickly, the head erect on his
shoulders, and slightly bent forward in the attitude of
a man who is looking attentively at the point towards
which he is going; the arms are not detached from the
body, and hang down along the bust and the thigh.
The composition is excellent, highly finished in spite of
the hardness of the material, and the detail is rendered
as freely as on the colossi of the Theban Period.</p>

<p>The face has a particular character which struck
Egyptologists long since; it is short, wide at the height
of the eyes, rounded at the bottom. The eye is long,
prominent, surmounted by strong curved eyebrows,
marked where they join on the forehead by two deep
vertical furrows. The nose is aquiline, short, thick at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
end, flanked by two nostrils the outside walls of which
seem to be somewhat thin. The mouth is widely opened
and protrudes; full lips, short chin receding a little under
the shadow of the lips. On his return from his journey
in Egypt, M. de Rougé was struck by the resemblance of
this statuette, till then lying forgotten in the corner of
a cupboard, with the portraits of the Shepherd Kings
discovered at Sân by Mariette. Dévéria cleverly reproduced
it in two plates in the <i>Revue archéologique</i>.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
He asserted what M. de Rougé had admitted as a mere
hypothesis: that it was the portrait of a Shepherd King,
and that it belonged to the disturbed period which
immediately preceded the XVIIIth Dynasty. I must
confess that these conclusions do not appear to me to
be sound. The long list of Pharaohs includes many
sovereigns whose faces present characteristics very
different from those usually attributed to the Egyptian
race, and yet who, all the same, were Egyptians
born and bred. Without entering into the discussion, I
will content myself with saying that several of those
who reigned at periods relatively late, Taharqa (XXVth
Dynasty) or Hakori (XXIXth Dynasty) for example,
bear a singular likeness to the sovereign of our statuette
in the structure and expression of the face. I cannot be
certain here that it is a question of one of them, but
the general composition reminds me of the style of the
Saïte Period more than of that of the Theban. Without
asserting anything, I am inclined to believe that our
Pharaoh lived in the last centuries of Egyptian independence.</p>

<div id="il_89" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 44em;">
  <img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="3465" height="1917" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>GREEN BASALT STATUETTES OF THE SAÏTE PERIOD.</p>

<p>The Louvre.</p></div></div>

<p>The second fragment is evidently Saïte; the somewhat
harsh precision of the modelling, the heaviness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
head-dress, the roundness of shoulders and chest,
sufficiently prove it. It is broken too high up for us to
determine if it belonged to a standing statue like the
Pharaoh, or a crouching figure like the third monument.
It is a perfect type of the middle-class Egyptian, developed
in width rather than in height.</p>

<p>The shoulders are soft and flabby; the smiling insignificance
of the features, the sinking down of the trunk on
the hips and the head on the shoulders, are just what we
should expect in one of the scribes who led sedentary
lives in offices, amid piles of documents, of whom some
bas-reliefs exaggerate the obesity with an evident intention
of caricature. The inscription engraved on the base tells
us that he was named Aî, son of Hapi, and that besides
his sacerdotal functions he possessed the dignity of director
of the two store-houses of the money. The Turin papyrus
informs us of the nature of his office. The financial system
of Egypt rested on an entirely different principle from ours:
coins not being yet invented, or only lately come into
use at the Saïte Period, the payment of taxes and of
the officials, the transactions of the State with private
individuals, or of private individuals with each other, were
valued and settled in kind. Every Egyptian owed the
Treasury, according to his profession and his fortune, so
many fish if he was a fisherman, so many bushels of grain
or head of cattle if he was an agriculturist; the whole was
duly received, registered, and stored by scribes who, in
their turn, put aside for the Pharaoh what would keep,
and used what was perishable for the daily disbursements.
Silver and gold were articles of exchange in the same way
as stuffs or oxen; Pharaoh brought them back in quantities
from his expeditions abroad, and received them from his
subjects as the equivalent of their share of the tax. Gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and silver circulated in powder, in sachets that contained
a definite weight, in thin rings, in the form of couchant
oxen, of half-oxen, of ox or gazelle heads, of jars full or
empty, in curious shapes that generally were of no use
in daily life, and which consequently were only, in spite
of their artistic value, a sort of metallic reserve for the
rich. The two store-houses or the double house of the
money formed the treasury in which Pharaoh stored
the quantities of gold and silver that belonged to him:
taking into account the value attached to these metals,
the directors of these establishments must have occupied
a fairly high rank in the Egyptian hierarchy.</p>

<p>But for all that, we must not take the manuscript
spread over Aî’s knees and that he is attentively reading
for an account-book, or a document relating to his
business. The portion of the scroll that he holds in his
right hand, placed flat on his knees, is divided into vertical
columns, which, cut by horizontal lines, presents a sort of
chequered surface, the squares of which are not all of the
same size. Each of the larger ones contains the name of
an object, and each of the smaller a number. It is the
list of the gifts composing the banquet offered to the dead
person on the day of burial and during the funeral ceremonies.
In the tombs both of the Ancient and the New
Empire it is highly developed, and comprises the most
varied materials: clear or coloured waters, beers of different
kinds, wines of four vintages, seven or nine of the choice
pieces of the victim, cakes of all sorts, essences, cosmetics,
stuffs. On the scroll of our scribe where the space was
restricted the list is shortened, and we only find the actual
necessities: water, beer, some meat, a little perfume.
It is to that of the tombs what the usual dinner of a
middle-class family is to the ceremonial banquet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
a noble; nevertheless, our scribe reads it with evident
satisfaction: it is the menu of his meals for eternity, and,
however scanty others may deem it, he probably considers
it more pleasurable than that of his terrestrial
dinners. We have here the natural development of the
ideas that the Egyptians had of the other world. From
the moment that the <i>double</i> was to feed materially, they
sought to assure it the food of which it had need. The
formulas of the stelæ which mention bread, wine, meat,
deciphered by the first comer, secured the provisioning
of the <i>double</i>; all that had been desired for him in
reciting it would be assured him in the other world by
virtue of the magic words. For lack of a passer-by to
accomplish this pious duty, it occurred to them to place
statues in the tomb which seemed to repeat for ever a
written list held on their knees; this simulation of a perpetual
reading was more than sufficient to nourish for ever
the simulacrum of a man. Here, it is the defunct himself
who renders himself this good office; elsewhere it is a
friend, a scribe, a favourite servant.</p>

<p>The study of these three little monuments brings out
very happily one of the qualities of Egyptian art: the skill
with which the least of artists, in reproducing in a sometimes
realistic manner the portrait of individuals, understood
how to seize the physiognomy and bearing characteristic
of their craft or of their social rank. Compare the
submissive and sheepish face of the crouching scribe with
the bold carriage and imperious head of the Pharaoh: the
contrast is striking. With the scribe, all the muscles are
relaxed; the whole body is bent, as with a man accustomed
to obey and resigned to endure everything from his
superiors. With the Pharaoh, the modelling is firm, the
figure upright, the mien haughty; we feel that here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
a person accustomed from childhood to walk upright in
the midst of bowed backs. It is unfortunate that the
legend has disappeared with the lower part of the second
statuette; comparing it with several other monuments in
the Louvre, it reminds me of several priests of the Saïte
Period. The hardness in the eye and the corners of the
lips is the same, the same furrow surrounds the nostril
and the mouth, the outer walls of the nose are compressed
in a similar fashion; in spite of the loss of the name and
titles, I am tempted to think that the individual who
bears on his face in so high a degree the peculiarities of
the Egyptian priest belonged to the sacerdotal caste.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">As</span> soon as I returned to my old post, I resumed the
excavations of the pyramids at the point where I had left
them in 1886. I had then made a systematic search of
the entrance into the funerary vaults: it was now
necessary to seek out the exterior chapels, the caves, the
secondary pyramids or the mastabas, which, shut in by
a walled enclosure, completed the burial-place. At the
end of November, 1899, I placed workmen round Ounas,
and as I found it impossible to direct the operations
myself with the requisite care, I entrusted the surveillance
of them to M. Alexandre Barsanti, the curator-restorer
of the Museum, with detailed instructions. The
campaign then begun was only ended in the last days of
May, 1900, and the account of it will be published
elsewhere. I now wish to draw the attention of
amateurs and scholars to the discovery of a mass of
Saïte jewels.</p>

<p>The progress of the clearing away revealed the
existence of a series of intact tombs at the south of
the pyramid. The last of those that had been opened
belonged to a very high personage named Zannehibou,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
in his lifetime commandant of the king’s boats. The
mummy, a block of shining bitumen, was at once recognised
as a very rich one. At the height of the face it had
a large gold mask which fitted on the front part of
the head like the <i>cartonnage</i> case usual with mummies
of the second Saïte Period. It had a broad necklace
round its neck of beads of gold and of green felspar or of
lapis lazuli mounted with gold thread, and fastened to it
were numerous amulets, also of gold. Below the necklace,
on the chest, an image of the goddess Nouît, in
gold, spread its wings. A network of gold and felspar
hung down to the hip, and from the image of the Nouît
to the ankles might be read, on a long band of gold-leaf,
the usual inscriptions in relief: the name of the dead
man, his filiation, with short formulas of prayer. Two
gold figures of Isis and Nephthys were sewn on the
chest, two leaves of gold cut as sandals were fitted to
the soles of the feet; a silver plaque with a line
engraving of a mystic eye for the incision whence the
entrails had been extracted, gold cases for the twenty
fingers and toes, completed this magnificent decoration.
Everything that with the lower classes of the same
period would have been in cardboard, or gilded paste, or
enamelled clay, was pure gold and fine stones with
Zannehibou. The find, estimated by weight alone, would
be valuable, but what gave it inestimable worth was the
delicate and artistic workmanship of the greater number
of the objects. A few of them, like the sandals and the
finger-cases, are only worth the raw metal; the rest
are the work of veritable artists. The inscriptions of
the legs, the winged Nouît, the Isis and the Nephthys, the
mask, are stamped, and although the mask and
the two goddesses were miserably crushed by the lid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
when the sarcophagus was closed, the mould of hard
stone which was used to fix them was so delicately
cut that the best-preserved pieces, the winged Nouît,
for instance, may be quoted as the highest degree of
perfection that could be attained by that process. The
amulet in shape of a necklace is only a leaf cut with
the chisel, on which a chapter of the “Book of the
Dead” is engraved with the graving needle. The vulture
amulet is a small, thin plaque, on one side of which
the stamped figure of a vulture with spread wings has
been stuck, while on the other the chapter of the “Book
of the Dead” has been engraved, as with the necklace.
It is all of good workmanship, but in the amulets hanging
on the real necklace of the mummy the goldsmith has
surpassed himself.</p>

<p class="p1">They are extraordinarily small, and in order to show
the detail I have had the illustrations made twice the
actual size, a proceeding that weakens the contours and
the modelling. To realize their beauty it is necessary
to have held them in the hand. The palm-tree, which
has lost some leaves, is a unique object, more curious
than elegant, but the mystic boat which is beside it,
unique also so far, is a prodigy of delicate chiselling.
It is the boat of the god Sokaris, a boat of most
archaic construction, and which was already used for the
accomplishment of the sacred rites under the Thinite
Dynasty. The belly is broad and round, the stern
rather heavy, but the bows very light and much
decorated. It rests on a sort of side-ladder of beams
and ropes, which is itself built on to a sledge: it was
pulled along in the public ceremonies by means of a
rope put through a hole made in the curved front of
the sledge. The decoration and the equipage are most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
curious. On the bow is a gazelle’s head with straight
horns turned to the interior, and along the prow a row of
divergent plates of thin metal, the use of which is not very
clear: it is as if the carcase of the gazelle was opened
and showed the ribs fixed on the spine. At the back, to
terminate the poop, there is a ram’s head with curved
horns. In the middle, on an oblong rectangular pedestal,
a hawk proudly perches; behind him are the four oar-rudders,
two on each side; in front of him six little
hawks ascend in procession, two by two, towards the
gazelle’s head, led by a Nile fish placed edgeways on its
ventral fin. For the moment I will not attempt to
explain the meaning of these emblems, but what we can
never grow tired of admiring is the cleverness with
which the craftsman has grouped these widely differing
elements into an harmonious whole, and especially the
extraordinary skill with which he worked his metal. His
gazelle’s head, a mere fraction of an inch in size, is of as
proud a bearing as if it were of natural size: everything
is exact, intelligent; the curve of the forehead, the
flattening of the snout, the expression of the face, even
to the natural pout of the creature. Each of the six
hawks preserves its individual physiognomy, and the fish
itself, reduced in size as it is, has the exact shape of the
big Nile perch, and not that of any sort of fish.</p>

<p>Similar qualities are to be seen in the neighbouring
pieces, in the ram’s head, the ordinary hawk, the hawk
with a human head, and that with a ram’s head, and in
the vulture. The seated Isis who nurses her child on
her lap and the crouching Neîth have their usual characteristics
of resignation and gentleness, and at the same
time the simplicity of line that lends so dignified an air
to the smallest Egyptian figures. It has all been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
chiselled out of the ingot itself, and the detail cut with
so minute a point that we ask where the artisan could
have obtained it.</p>

<p>Tiny lions addorsed or couchant, tiny mystic eyes,
tiny monkeys worshipping the emblem of Osiris, tiny
vultures, and tiny hawks extending their wings, each
piece claims careful examination, and would by itself
alone bring joy to the heart of a collector. The masterpiece
of the series is, however, the <i>soul</i>, the hawk with
a human head, enamelled body and wings, of which both
back and front views are here reproduced. The back
follows the usual manner, small rods of bent gold, curved,
soldered on to a gold plaque and encrusted with thin
plates of felspar to simulate feathers; but on the other side,
the body, wings, and claws are modelled with the new
purpose of reproducing the natural form of the bird.
The little human head is a marvel of somewhat weak
gracefulness: the eyes are well open, the mouth is smiling,
the nostrils actually palpitate, the ear is cut out and
is hollowed broad and high as is customary, and there
is nothing, even to the wrinkles of the neck and the
roundness of a double chin, that does not clearly stand out
under the reflection of the gold. Here again, it is all
chiselled by a master-hand, with a sureness I have only
found in the hawk with a ram’s head in the Louvre,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> with
which this <i>soul of Gizeh</i> may be compared.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the discovery would not have
informed us of the date, if the style of the jewels had
not done so. It is Saïte art with its lightness, suppleness,
somewhat arch charm, its almost too high relief. A
tendency is felt in the direction of the exaggerated
roundness of the Ptolemies, and, in fact, a note furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
by M. Chassinat permits us to fix the time at which
Zannehibou lived. He belonged to the family of a
certain Psammetichus, whose tomb is near his, which an
inscription in the Louvre found by Mariette in the
Serapeum places at the beginning of the fifth century,
during the last years of the reign of Darius I. If, as is
likely, he was the grandson of that Psammetichus, he
died at the end of the fourth century, just when the
Saïte kings were resuming their superiority over the
Persians, at most, a hundred years before the Macedonian
conquest. The goldsmiths who fashioned his ornaments
had probably seen Greek jewels, and had perhaps already
felt Hellenic influence: in that way the almost Ptolemaic
characteristics of the collection are explained. We know
that Saïte jewels are very rare; the Louvre alone possesses
any that are out of the ordinary run: the two necklace
fastenings in form of a ship bought by M. G. Bénédite
a few years ago. The mummy of Zannehibou has filled up
the lacuna in the Gizeh series, and thanks to it, we now
know that the goldsmith’s art yielded in nothing to the
other arts at the time of the last Egyptian renaissance.
Let us add that these jewels, although found on a mummy
and made for it, are not, as is too often the case, jewels
of the dead, pleasing in colour and design, but too weakly
mounted to stand the wear and tear if worn by a living
person. Like the jewels of Ramses II in the Louvre,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
like those of Queen Ahhotpou at Gizeh, they are real
jewels, identical at all points, except perhaps in the choice
of subjects, with the jewels worn every day.</p>

<p>Such is the find that made a happy termination to
our Saqqarah campaign. All the pieces were covered with
bitumen, and it is no slight merit to M. Barsanti that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
he should have discovered them and separated them one
after the other. Several pits, equally untouched, await
us at the same spot under fifteen or eighteen yards
of sand, and I have a good hope that next year’s excavations
may have as glad surprises for us as those of
this year.</p>

<span class="subhead">A BRONZE EGYPTIAN CAT BELONGING TO
M. BARRÈRE<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor smaller">92</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">This</span> fine bronze cat was purchased at Cairo in 1884 by
M. Barrère, then agent and consul-general of France in
Egypt. It belongs to the innumerable family of cats
which suddenly came forth from the ruins of Tell Bastah
in 1878, and were, in a few years, scattered over the
whole world. It measures 1 foot 4⅛ inches in height,
and if not the largest found at that time, it is at least
bigger than the average. But its size is not its chief
merit: the Egyptians, who were the first to tame the cat,
studied it so closely that they expressed its characteristics
with extraordinary excellence. M. Barrère’s cat is firmly
seated on her hind-quarters, looking straight in front of
her, in the satisfied attitude of an animal which has done
its duty and has nothing to reproach itself with. The
wooden pedestal to which it was attached is wanting,
but the metal tenon which fastened it is still in its place,
and the body is in a perfect state of preservation. It
was moulded in one piece round a core of sand that has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
disappeared, then touched up with the burin and the file,
and then polished; it has not suffered from its long
sojourn in the earth, and we can judge its qualities or
its defects as clearly as if it had been made yesterday. It
is a fine piece, of very sure design and careful execution.
The artist was not afraid to multiply the details, and he
has simplified the surfaces; but the force of the line, the
robust and vigorous character of the execution, make his
work a piece of the first rank. It is wonderful to note
the intelligent skill with which he has expressed the
characteristics and physiognomy of the race. The haunch
is broad and round, the back supple, the neck slender,
the head delicate, the ear straight; it is the Egyptian
cat in all its elegance, as we can still see it among
the fellahs, for crossing with foreign species has not
altered it.</p>

<p>She is Bastît, a goddess of good family, the worship
of whom flourished especially in the east of the delta,
and she is very often drawn or named on the monuments,
although they do not tell us enough of her myths or
her origin. She was allied or related to the Sun, and
was now said to be his sister or wife, now his daughter.
She sometimes filled a beneficent and gracious rôle, protecting
men against contagious diseases or evil spirits,
keeping them off by the music of her sistrum: she had
also her hours of treacherous perversity, during which she
played with her victim as with a mouse, before finishing
him off with a blow of her claws. She dwelt by
preference in the city that bore her name, Poubastît, the
Bubastis of classical writers. Her temple, at which
Cheops and Chephrên had worked while they were
building their pyramids, was rebuilt by the Pharaohs of
the XXIInd Dynasty, enlarged by those of the XXVIth;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
when Herodotus visited it in the middle of the fifth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, he considered it one of the most remarkable
he had seen in the parts of Egypt through which
he had travelled. It stood in the centre of the city,
at the end of the market-place. It was bordered by
two canals, each 100 feet wide and shaded by trees; they
flowed without joining, one on the right, the other on
the left of the building, almost making it an artificial
island. Travellers before entering it looked over the
enclosure, even into the exterior court-yards, for Bubastis
had undergone the fate of many of the large cities of
Egypt; in the course of ages the ground became raised
in such a way that the foundations of recent houses
were on a higher level than those of the temple. A big
wall, decorated with pictures like the outer wall of the
temple of Edfou, enclosed the temenos. The fêtes of
Bastît attracted pilgrims from all parts of Egypt, as at
the present day those of Sidi Ahmed el-Bedaouî draw
people to the modern fair of Tantah. The people of
each village crowded into large boats to get there, men
and women pell-mell, with the fixed intention of enjoying
themselves on the journey, a thing they never
failed to do. They accompanied the slow progress of
navigation with endless songs, love songs rather than
sacred hymns, and there were always to be found among
them flute players and castanet players to support or
keep time to the voices. Whenever they passed by a town,
they approached the bank as near as they could without
landing, and then, while the orchestra redoubled its noise,
the passengers threw volleys of insults and coarse remarks
at the women standing on the bank; they retorted, and
when they had exhausted words, they pulled up their
petticoats and behaved indecently by way of reply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Herodotus was told that 700,000 persons, equal numbers
of men and women, not reckoning little children, went
thus every year to Bubastis. Entry into the temple
did not calm them, far from it. They sacrificed a great
number of victims with a sincere and joyous piety; then
they drank deeply from morning to evening, and from evening
to morning, as long as the festival lasted: more wine
was consumed in a few days than in all the rest of the
year put together.</p>

<p>The greater number of the pilgrims, before returning
home, left a souvenir of their visit at the feet of Bastît.
It was a votive stele with a fine inscription, and a
picture showing the donor worshipping his goddess; or a
statuette in blue or green pottery, or if they were
wealthy, in bronze, silver, or sometimes gold: the goddess
would be standing, seated, crouching with a woman’s
body and a cat’s head, a sistrum or an ægis in her hand.
During the Greek period the figures were in bronze or
in painted and gilded wood surmounted by a cat’s head
in bronze. Many were life-size and modelled with
elaborate art; they had eyes of enamel, a gilded necklace
round the neck, earrings, and amulets on the forehead.
It sometimes happened that when a cat he particularly
venerated died in his house, the pilgrim embalmed it
according to the rites: he took the mummy with him, and,
arrived at Bubastis, shut it up in one of the figures he
offered. These various objects, at first placed anywhere
in the temple, would quickly have filled it, if some remedy
had not been found. They were piled up provisionally
at the end of one of the secondary chambers, then thrown
outside, and there encountered diverse fortunes. I do not
think I am calumniating the Egyptian priests in saying
that it must have been a great grief to them to part with so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
many precious gifts without trying to derive some honest
profit from them. The gold and silver figures did not
endure; they quickly went into the melting-pot, and few
emerge from the ruins, but the bronze and copper were so
abundant that there would have been little to gain in melting
down the cats. So they sorted out the heap of bronzes,
and while they kept some, the finest, doubtless, or those
that bore inscriptions, they sold the rest to new generations
of pilgrims, who, in their turn, offered them in due form.
However frequently this was done, the influx was considerable,
and they were forced to rid themselves quickly of
the pieces that had at first been kept in reserve. They
shut them up in cellars, or in pits dug expressly for them,
veritable <i>favissæ</i> similar to those of classical times;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> they
accumulated by thousands, large and small, in wood and in
bronze, some intact and fresh as when just made, others
already out of shape, rotten, oxidized and of no value.
The places of concealment were soon forgotten, and the
stuff in them reposed there beyond the reach of men
until the day when the chances of excavation brought
it to light.</p>

<p>One of them restored M. Barrère’s cat. It is not
possible to determine the period at which it was buried:
the persons who found it were seekers of nitreous manure,
or dealers in antiquities who took good care not to divulge
the circumstances and the site of their discovery. But
judging from the roundness of certain forms and the
aspect of the bronze, we recognize the style of the second
Saïte Period, and the piece is to be attributed either to
the Nectanebos, or the first Ptolemies, in a general way
to the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or the beginning of the third
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> It was the time when the worship of Bastît<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
and her subordinate forms, Pakhît, Maît, was most
popular, the period when, near Speos-Artemidos, the most
extensive cemetery of cats in Egypt was established. The
execution is pure Egyptian, and in no way betrays any
Greek influence.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> was announced in the English newspapers, and the
French followed suit, that a ship had recently reached
London and disembarked 180,000 mummies of Egyptian
cats. For a long time manufacturers of different nationalities
have been accustomed to seek out the burying
grounds of animals throughout Egypt, and to export the
bones to Europe, where they are used as manure. A few
years ago a necropolis full of monkeys was sent to Germany
to manure beet-root fields. It seems that the cats of this
year were discovered near Beni-Hassan; they were piled
up at hazard in a sort of cavern, into which a fellah in
search of antiquities was the first to penetrate. In fact,
at some distance to the south of the hypogeums of Beni-Hassan,
in the place called by geographers Speos-Artemidos,
is a chapel hollowed out in the rock, and consecrated
by the kings of the XVIIIth and XIXth Dynasties
to a local goddess, a woman’s body with a cat’s or lion’s
head, called Pakhît. The depôt recently exploited was
found there, and the cats which reposed in it must have
lived in the vicinity, under the protection of their cousin,
the goddess. Cemeteries of the same kind existed
wherever a divinity of a feline type was worshipped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
lion, tiger, or cat. The most celebrated was at Bubastis,
in the delta, where the seekers of antiquities cleared
away the rubbish about thirty-seven years ago.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> The
mummies of cats were buried there in <i>favissæ</i>, deep pits,
some merely wrapped in swathings, others enclosed in
little coffins reproducing the image of the animal. Some
of these coffins are entirely of wood covered with white
stucco, gilded, painted in bright colours; some are in
bronze, others have the body in wood and the head in
bronze, with gold rings in their ears and encrustations of
gold on the forehead and in the eyes. Statuettes of cats
of different sizes, portraits of the goddess Bastît with a
cat’s head, or of the god Nofirtoumou, are mingled with
the mummies. Thence come the thousands of bronze
cats, big and little, with which all the antiquaries of Europe
and Cairo were so abundantly provided from 1876 to 1888.
The important cat illustrated here, and who lives now in
one of the glass cases in the “Salle divine” of the Louvre,
is a perfect type of the species, long, slender in the back,
broad in the hind-quarters, with a delicate, well-set head,
rings in the ears, a necklace round the neck, and a little
scarab on the top of the head; the artist who modelled it
has rendered excellently and truthfully the supple bearing
and the bold physiognomy of his original.</p>

<p>The cats represented on the monuments, or the
mummies of which are found in Egypt, were not of the
same race as our domestic cat. Scholars have studied
them and are unanimous—Virchow, too, recently—in
recognizing them as the <i>Felis maniculata</i> and the <i>Felis
chaus</i>. Egypt had tamed a few individual ones, but
had not domesticated the whole species. They are
sometimes to be seen on the bas-reliefs solemnly seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
near their masters. It is commonly asserted that
they were used for hunting birds in the marshes, and
Wilkinson quotes in support a fairly large number of
mural paintings where they stalk through the reeds,
routing out little birds. I confess that this interpretation
does not seem to me to be correct. Where
others claim to recognize animals ready for the chase and
acting on behalf of man, I only see animals, tame or not,
on marauding bent and scouring the bushes for their own
purposes; just as our domesticated cat chases the sparrows
in our gardens and destroys the nests in our parks without
any advantage to his master. Egyptian artists, very acute
observers of what was going on around them, reproduced
their cats’ expeditions, as they noted other picturesque
details of the life of nature.</p>

<p>If we examined the 180,000 cats—neither more nor
less—we should probably come upon a fairly large proportion
of ichneumons. In Egypt the ichneumon and
the cat were always associated; wherever there are
mummies of cats it may be safely assumed that
mummies of ichneumons are not far off. Cats or
ichneumons, I hope the whole of them will not be
used to manure the ground, but that some fine specimens
may be chosen for the museums of antiquities and
of natural history: in sparing a few hundreds, agriculture
will not lose much, and science will gain considerably.
The origin of our tom-cat has long been under discussion;
some refer it to Egypt, others to Europe. It would be
a pity not to profit by such an invasion of Egyptian cats,
and to try to obtain a definite solution of the question.</p>

woman of low stature crouches behind her seated husband (“Denkmäler,”

seated on the same armchair, and the wife puts her right arm round
her husband’s neck (“Denkmäler,” ii., 10<i>b</i>, 24, 25<i>b</i>, 41<i>b</i>, 42<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, 75<i>a</i>,

is of heroic stature (“Denkmäler,” ii., 38<i>b</i>); she stands behind him
and puts her arm round his left arm (“Denkmäler,” ii., 27, 33<i>a</i>),
or she puts her arm round his waist (“Denkmäler,” ii., 38<i>a</i>); and lastly,
the husband and wife, of the same stature, are standing, the wife behind
her husband and putting her arm round his neck (“Denkmäler,” ii.,
13, 20–1, 29<i>b</i>, 32, 34<i>b</i>, 40<i>b</i>, 43<i>b</i>, 46, 58<i>a</i>, 59<i>b</i>), or separated from him

Senotmhît, surnamed Mihi, is seated, of heroic stature, while his
wife, Khontkaous, is represented crouching and of low stature,
although she is a legitimate daughter of the king. In another part
of the tomb (Lepsius, “Denkmäler,” ii., 73) the same persons are
represented standing side by side and of heroic stature, while their
children are of ordinary stature.</p>

belonging to one same god whom he qualified as Prince of Eternity
in the singular, later regarded them as belonging to three different

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Spelling discrepancies between the main text and
the Index were resolved in favor of the main text.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unpaired
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unpaired.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions
of this eBook that support hyperlinks, the page
references in the List of Illustrations lead to the
corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>Most full-page illustrations included printer’s
instructions specifying “To face p. xxx.” Those
instructions have been removed from this eBook.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages,
have been collected, sequentially numbered, and
placed at the end of this eBook, just before the
Index. References to those footnotes have been
renumbered in the same way.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>
